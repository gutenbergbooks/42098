<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>A stained glass window is itself the best possible illustration
of the difference it makes whether we look at a thing from this
side or from that. G&#339;the used this particular image in one of
his little parables, comparing poems to painted windows, dark
and dull from the market-place, bright with colour and alive
with meaning only when we have crossed the threshold of
the church.</p>

<p>I may claim to have entered the sanctuary, and not irreverently.
My earliest training in design was in the workshops of
artists in stained glass. For many years I worked exclusively
at glass design, and for over a quarter of a century I have spent
great part of my leisure in hunting glass all Europe over.</p>

<p>This book has grown out of my experience. It makes no
claim to learnedness. It tells only what the windows have told
me, or what I understood them to say. I have gone to glass to
get pleasure out of it, to learn something from it, to find out
the way it was done, and why it was done so, and what might
yet perhaps be done. Anything apart from that did not so much
interest me. Those, therefore, who desire minuter and more
precise historic information must consult the works of Winston,
Mr. Westlake, and the many continental authorities, with whose
learned writings this more practical, and, in a sense, popular,
volume does not enter into any sort of competition.</p>

<p>My point of view is that of art and workmanship, or, more
precisely speaking, workmanship and art, workmanship being
naturally the beginning and root of art. We are workmen
first and artists afterwards&mdash;perhaps.</p>

<p>What I have tried to do is this: In the first place (<a href="#Page_1">Book I.</a>),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi"></a></span>
I set out to trace the course of <i>workmanship</i>, to follow the
technique of the workman from the twelfth century to the
seventeenth, from mosaic to painting, from archaism to pictorial
accomplishment; and to indicate at what cost of perhaps more
decorative qualities the later masterpieces of glass painting were
bought.</p>

<p>In the second place (<a href="#Page_111">Book II.</a>), I have endeavoured to show
the course of <i>design</i> in glass, from the earliest Medi√¶val window
to the latest glass picture of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>Finally (<a href="#Page_322">Book III.</a>), I have set apart for separate discussion
questions not in the direct line either of design or workmanship,
or which, if taken by the way, would have hindered the
narrative and confused the issue.</p>

<p>The rather lengthy chapter on &#8220;<i>Style</i>&#8221; is addressed to that
large number of persons who, knowing as yet nothing about the
subject, may want <i>data</i> by which to form some idea as to the
period of a window when they see it: the postscript more nearly
concerns the designer and the worker in glass.</p>

<p>In all this I have tried to put personality as much as possible
aside, and to tell my story faithfully and without conscious bias.
But I make no claim to impartiality, as the judge upon the
bench understands it. We take up art or law according to our
temperament. I can pretend to judge only as one interested,
to be impartial only as an artist may.</p>

<h2><i>NOTE IN REFERENCE TO ILLUSTRATIONS.</i></h2>

<p><i>Theoretically the illustrations to a book about windows
should be in colour. Practically coloured illustrations of
stained glass are out of the question, as all who appreciate its
quality well know. It may be possible, although it has hardly
proved so as yet, to print adequate representations of coloured
windows, but only at a cost which would defeat the end here
in view.</i></p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">EFFECT</span> <i>of glass is best suggested by process renderings
of photographs from actual windows or from very careful
water-colour drawings, such as those very kindly placed at my
disposal by Mr. T. M. Rooke (pages <a href="#Fig_72">128</a>, <a href="#Fig_112">159</a>, <a href="#Fig_229">337</a>) and
Mr. John R. Clayton (pages <a href="#Fig_35">51</a>, <a href="#Fig_44">74</a>, <a href="#Fig_54">98</a>, <a href="#Fig_142">186</a>,
<a href="#Fig_156">207</a>, <a href="#Fig_174">252</a>, <a href="#Fig_191">286</a>, <a href="#Fig_206">304</a>, <a href="#Fig_234">342</a>),
an artist whose studio has been the nursery of a whole generation of glass designers.</i></p>

<p><i>Details of</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">DESIGN</span> <i>are often better seen in the reproductions
of tracings or slight pen-drawings, little more than diagrams it
may be, but done to illustrate a point. That is the intention
throughout, to illustrate what is said, not simply to beautify
the book.</i></p>

<p><i>The direction of the pen-lines gives, wherever it was possible,
a key to the colour scheme. Red, that is to say, is represented
by vertical lines, blue by horizontal, yellow by dots, and so on,
according to heraldic custom.</i></p>

<h2>WINDOWS, A BOOK
ABOUT STAINED GLASS<br />
<br />
BOOK I.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
<br />
THE BEGINNINGS OF GLASS.</h3>

<p>The point of view from which the subject of stained glass is
approached in these chapters relieves me, happily, from the
very difficult task of determining the date or the whereabouts
of the remote origin of coloured windows, and the still remoter
beginnings of glass itself. The briefest summary of scarcely
disputable facts bearing upon the evolution of the art of
window making, is here enough. We need not vex our minds
with speculation.</p>

<p>White glass (and that of extreme purity) would seem to have
been known to the Chinese as long ago as 2300 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, for they
were then already using astronomical instruments, of which
the lenses were presumably of glass. Of coloured glass there
is yet earlier record. Egyptologists tell us that at least five if
not six thousand years ago the Egyptians made jewels of glass.
Indeed, it is more than probable that this was the earliest use
to which stained glass was put, and that the very <i>raison d&#8217;√™tre</i>
of glass making was a species of forgery. In some of the most
ancient tombs have been found scarabs of glass in deliberate
imitation of rubies and emeralds, sapphires and other precious
stones. The glass beads found broadcast in three quarters of
the globe were quite possibly passed off by Ph&#339;nician traders
upon the confiding barbarian as jewels of great price. At all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
events, glass beads, according to Sir John Lubbock, were in
use in the bronze age; and, if we may trust the evidence of
etymology, &#8220;bedes&#8221; are perhaps as ancient as praying.</p>

<p>Apart from trickery and fraud, to imitate seems to be a
foible of humanity. The Greeks and their Roman successors
made glass in imitation of agate and onyx and all kinds of
precious marbles. They devised also coloured glass coated
with white glass, which could be cut cameo-fashion&mdash;a kind of
glass much used, though in a different way, in later Medi√¶val
windows.</p>

<p>The Venetians carried further the pretty Greek invention of
embedding vitreous threads of milky white or colour in clear
glass, the most beautiful form of which is that known as <i>latticelli</i>,
or <i>reticelli</i> (reticulated or lace glass), from the elaborate twisting
and interlacing of the threads; but nothing certain seems to
be known about Venetian glass until the end of the eleventh
century, although by the thirteenth the neighbouring island
of Murano was famous for its production. The Venetians
found a new stone to imitate, aventurine, and they imitated
it marvellously.</p>

<p>So far, however, glass was used in the first instance for
jewellery, and in the second for vessels of various kinds. Its
use in architecture was confined mainly to mosaic, originally,
no doubt, to supply the place of brighter tints not forthcoming
in marble.</p>

<p>Of the use of glass in windows there is not very ancient
mention. The climate of Greece or Egypt, and the way of
life there, gave scant occasion for it. But at Herculaneum
and Pompeii, there have been found fair sized slabs of window
glass, not of very perfect manufacture, apparently cast, and
probably at no time very translucent. Remains also of what
was presumably window glass have been found among the
ruins of Roman villas in England. In the basilicas of Christian
Rome the arched window openings were sometimes filled
with slabs of marble, in which were piercings to receive glass
(which may or may not have been coloured), foreshadowing,
so to speak, the plate tracery of Early Gothic builders.
According to M. L√©vy, the windows of Early Medi√¶val
Flemish churches were often filled in this Roman way with
plaques of stone pierced with circular openings to receive
glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Another Roman practice was to set panes of glass in bronze
or copper framing, and even in lead. Here we have the
beginning of the practice identified with Medi√¶val glaziers.</p>

<p>There is no reason to suppose that the ancients practised
glass painting as we understand it. Discs of Greek glass have
been found which are indeed painted, but not (I imagine) with
colour fused with the material; and certainly these were not
used for windows.</p>

<p>The very early Christians were not in a position to indulge in,
or even to desire, luxuries such as stained glass windows, but
St. Jerome and St. Chrysostom make allusion to them. It is
pretty certain that these must have been simple mosaics in
stained glass, unpainted: one reads that between the lines of
the records that have come down to us.</p>

<p>Stained and painted glass, such as we find in the earliest
existing Medi√¶val windows, may possibly date back to the
reign of Charlemagne (800), but it may safely be said not to
occur earlier than the Holy Roman Empire. A couple of
hundred years later mention of it begins to occur rather
frequently in Church records; and there is one particular
account of the furnishing of the chapel of the first Benedictine
Monastery at Monte Cassino with a whole series of windows
in 1066&mdash;which fixes the date of the Norman Conquest as
a period at which stained glass windows can no longer have
been uncommon. The Cistercian interdict, restricting the
order to the use of white glass (1134), argues something like
ecclesiastical over-indulgence in rich windows before the middle
of the next century.</p>

<p>Fragments, more or less plentiful, of the very earliest glass
may still remain embedded in windows of a later period (the
material was too precious not to have been carefully preserved);
but arch√¶ologists appear to be agreed that no complete
window of the ninth or tenth century has been preserved,
and that even of the eleventh there is nothing that can
quite certainly be identified. After that doctors begin to differ.
But the general consensus of opinion is, that there is comparatively
little that can be incontrovertibly set down even to the
twelfth century. The great mass of Early Gothic Glass belongs
indubitably to the thirteenth century; and when one speaks
of Early Glass it is usually thirteenth century work which is
meant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
The remote origin of glass, then, remains for ever lost in the
mist of legendary days. There is even a fable to the effect that
it dates from the building of the Tower of Babel, when God&#8217;s
fire from heaven vitrified the bricks employed by its too presumptuous
builders.</p>

<p>Coloured glass comes to us from the East; that much it is
safe to conclude. From ancient Egypt, probably, the art of the
glass-worker found its way to Ph&#339;nicia, thence to Greece and
Rome, and so to Byzantium, Venice, and eventually France,
where stained glass windows, as we know them, first occur.</p>

<p>It is probably to the French that Europe owes the introduction
of coloured windows, a colony of Venetian glass-workers having,
they say, settled at Limoges in the year 979.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest French glass is to be found at Chartres,
Le Mans, Angers, Reims, and Ch√¢lons-s√ªr-Marne; and at the
<i>Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs</i>, at Paris, there are some fragments
of twelfth century work which may be more conveniently
examined than the work <i>in sit√ª</i>. The oldest to which one can
assign a definite date is that at St. Denis (1108) but its value
is almost nullified by expert restoration.</p>

<p>In Germany the oldest date is ascribed to some small
windows at Augsburg, executed, it is said, by the monks of
Tegernsee about the year 1000. There is also a certain amount
of twelfth century work incorporated in the later windows at
Strasbourg. The oldest remains of glass in England are, in
all probability, certain fragments in the nave of York Minster.
The more important windows at Canterbury, Salisbury, and
Lincoln are of the thirteenth century.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
<br />
THE MAKING OF A WINDOW.</h3>

<p>Since it is proposed to approach the subject of stained glass
in the first place from the workmanlike and artistic, rather
than the historical or antiquarian, point of view, it may
be as well to begin by explaining precisely what a stained
glass window is.</p>

<p>It is usual to confound &#8220;stained&#8221; with &#8220;painted&#8221; glass.
Literally speaking, these are two quite distinct things. Stained
glass is glass which is coloured, as the phrase goes, &#8220;in the
pot;&#8221; that is to say, there is mixed with the molten white
glass a metallic oxide which stains it green, yellow, blue,
purple, and so on, as the case may be; for which reason this
self-tinted glass is called &#8220;pot-metal.&#8221; This is a term which
will recur again and again. Once for all, &#8220;pot-metal&#8221; is glass
in which the colour is <i>in</i> the glass and not painted <i>upon</i> it.</p>

<p>It goes without explanation that, each separate sheet of pot-metal
glass being all of one colour, a varicoloured window
can only be produced in it by breaking up the sheets and
putting them together in the form of a mosaic: in fact, that
is how the earliest windows were executed, and they go by the
name of mosaic glass. The glass is, however, not broken
up into tesser√¶, but shaped according to the forms of the
design. In short, those portions of it which are white have
to be cut out of a sheet of white glass, those which are blue out
of a sheet of blue glass, those which are yellow out of a sheet
of yellow, and so on; and it is these pieces of variously tinted
glass, bound together by strips of lead, just as the tesser√¶
of a pavement or wall picture are held in place by cement,
which constitute a stained glass window. The artist is as yet
not concerned in painting, but in glazing&mdash;that is to say,
putting together little bits of glass, just as an inlayer does, or
as a mosaic worker puts together pieces of wood, or marble,
or burnt clay, or even opaque glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
There is illustrated <a href="#Fig_1">opposite</a> a piece of Old Burmese
incrusted decoration, a mosaic of white and coloured glass
bound together by strips of metal, which, were it but clear
instead of silvered at the back, would be precisely the same
thing as an early mosaic window, even to the completion
of the face by means of paint&mdash;of which more presently.
In painted glass, on the other hand, the colour is not in the
glass but upon it, more or less firmly attached to it by the
action of the fire. A metallic colour which has some affinity
with glass, or which is ground up with finely powdered glass,
is used as a pigment, precisely as ceramic colours are used
in pottery painting. The painted glass is then put into a kiln
and heated to the temperature at which it is on the point of
melting, whilst the colour actually does melt into it. By this
means it is possible to paint a coloured picture upon a single
sheet of white glass, as has been proved at S√®vres.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, then, stained and painted glass are the
very opposite one to the other. But in practice the two
processes of glazing and painting were never kept apart.
The very earliest glass was no doubt pure mosaic. It
was only in our own day that the achievement (scientific
rather than artistic) of a painted window of any size, independent
of glazier&#8217;s work, was possible. Painting was at first
always subsidiary to glazier&#8217;s work; after that, for a time,
glazier and painter worked hand in hand upon equal terms;
eventually the painter took precedence, and the glazier
became ever more and more subservient to him. But from the
twelfth to the seventeenth century there is little of what we call,
rather loosely, sometimes &#8220;stained&#8221; and sometimes &#8220;painted&#8221;
glass, in which there is not both staining and painting&mdash;that
is to say, stained glass is used, and there is painting upon it.
The difference is that in the earlier work the painting is
only used to help out the stained glass, and in the later the
stained glass is introduced to help the painting.</p>

<small>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Photo-Tint</span>,&#8221; by James Akerman, London W. C.</small></span></p>

<p>That amounts, it may be thought, to much the same thing;
and there does come a point where staining and painting fulfil
each such an important part in the window that it is difficult
to say which is the predominating partner in the concern. For
the most part, however, there is no manner of doubt as to which
practice was uppermost in the designer&#8217;s mind, as to the idea
with which he set out, painting or glazing; and it makes all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a><br /><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
difference in the work&mdash;the difference, for example, between a
window of the thirteenth century and one of the sixteenth,
a difference about which a child could scarcely make a mistake,
once it had been pointed out to him.</p>

<p>Here perhaps it will be as well to describe, once for all, the
making of a mosaic window, and the part taken in it by the
glazier and the painter respectively. It will be easier then
to discriminate between the two processes employed, and to
discuss them each in relation to the other.</p>

<p>The actual construction of an early window is very much
like the putting together of a puzzle. The puzzle of our
childhood usually took the form of a map. It has occurred
to me, therefore, to show how an artist working strictly after
the manner of the thirteenth century&mdash;the period, that is to
say, when painting was subsidiary to glazing&mdash;would set about
putting into glass a map of modern Italy. In the first place, he
would draw his map to the size required. This he would do
with the utmost precision, firmly marking upon the paper (the
medi√¶val artist would have drawn directly on his wooden
bench) the boundary line of each separate patch of colour
in his design. Then, according to the colour each separate
province or division was to be, he would take a separate sheet
of &#8220;pot-metal&#8221; and lay it over the drawing, so as to be
able to trace upon the glass itself the outline of such province
or division. That done, he would proceed to cut out or shape
the various pieces of glass to the given forms. In the case of a
simple and compact province, such as Rome, Tuscany, Umbria
(<a href="#Fig_2">overleaf</a>), that would be easy enough. On the other hand, a
more irregular shape, say the province of Naples, with its promontories,
would present considerable difficulties&mdash;difficulties
practically insuperable by the early glazier, to whom the diamond
as a cutting instrument was unknown, and whose appliances
for shaping were of the rudest and most rudimentary.</p>

<p>If with the point of a red-hot iron you describe upon a sheet
of glass a line, and then, taking the material between your two
hands, proceed to snap it across, the fracture will take approximately
the direction of the line thus drawn. That is how the
thirteenth century glazier went to work, subsequently with
a notched iron instrument, or &#8220;grozing iron&#8221; as it was called,
laboriously chipping away the edges until he had reduced each
piece of glass to the precise shape he wanted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
It will be seen at once that the simpler the line and the
easier its sweep the more likely the glass would be to break
clean to the line, whereas in the case of a jagged or irregular
line there would always be great danger that at any one sharp
turn in it the fracture would take that convenient opportunity
of going in the way it should not. For example, the south
coast of Italy would be dangerous. You might draw the line
of the sole of the foot, but when it came to breaking the glass
the high heel would be sure to snap off (there is a little nick
there designed as if for the purpose of bringing about that
catastrophe), and similarly that over-delicate instep would
certainly not bear the strain put upon it, and would be bound
to give way. It should be mentioned that even were such
pieces once safely cut (which would nowadays be possible) the
glass would surely crack at those points the first time there
was any pressure of wind upon the window, and so the
prudent man would still forestall that event by designing his
glass as it could conveniently be cut, without attempting any
<i>tour de force</i>, and strengthening it at the weak points with a
line of lead, as has been done in the glass map <a href="#Fig_2">opposite</a>.
There is a jutting promontory on the coast of Africa, which,
even if safely cut, would be sure to break sooner or later at the
point indicated by the dotted line.</p>

<p>The scale of execution would determine whether each or
any province could be cut out of a single sheet of glass, but
the lines of latitude and longitude would give an opportunity
of using often three or four pieces of glass to a province without
introducing lines which formed no part of the design.
That, however, would be contrary to early usage, which was
never to make use of the leads as independent lines, but only
as boundaries between two colours. There is a reason for this
reticence. You will see that in the surface of the sea, where
the latitudinal and longitudinal lines come in most usefully, it
is necessary to use also other leads, which mean nothing but
that a joint is there desirable. These constructional leads,
when they merely break up a background, are quite unobjectionable&mdash;they
even give an opportunity of getting variety in
the colour of the ground&mdash;but when some of the leads are
meant to assert themselves as drawing lines and some are not,
the result is inevitably confused.</p>

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">2. THE WAY A WINDOW IS GLAZED.</span></p>

<p>All that the glass gives us in our mosaic map is the local
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><br /><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
colour of sea and land&mdash;the sea, let us say, dark blue, the
countries, provinces, and islands each of its own distinctive tint.
When it comes to giving their names, it would be possible
indeed on a very large scale to cut the letters out of glass of
darker colour, and glaze them in as shown in the title word
&#8220;Italy.&#8221; That would involve, as will be seen, a network of
connecting lead lines. On a much smaller scale there would
be nothing for it but to have recourse to the supplementary
process, and paint them. The words Germany, Austria,
Turkey, Naples, Sicily, and the rest would have to be simply
painted in opaque colour upon the translucent glass.</p>

<p>But, once we have begun to use paint, there are intermediate
ways between these two methods of inscription, either of which
would be adopted according to the scale of the lettering. These
are shown in the names of the seas. In the word &#8220;Mediterranean&#8221;
each separate letter would be cut out of a piece of
glass, corresponding as nearly as possible to its general outline
or circumference, and its shape would be made perfect by
&#8220;painting out&#8221;&mdash;that is to say, by obscuring with solid pigment
that part of the glass (indicated by dots in the drawing) which
was meant to retire into the background. Presuming this
wording to be in a light colour and the background darkish,
this amount of painting would, as a matter of fact, be quite lost
in the dark colour. In the lesser descriptions &#8220;Tyrrhenian&#8221;
and &#8220;Adriatic Sea,&#8221; each separate word, instead of each
letter, would be cut out of one piece of glass (or perhaps two
in the longer words), and the background would be painted
out as already described.</p>

<p>Paint would further be used to indicate the rivers, the
mountains, the towns, or any other detail it was necessary
to give, as well as to mark such indentations in the coastline
as were too minute to be followed by the thick lead. As a
matter of practice, it is usual to paint a marginal line of opaque
colour round the glass representing just a little more than that
portion eventually to be covered by the flange of the lead, so
as to make sure that that will not by any chance cut off from
view what may be an important feature in the design.</p>

<p>For example, the mere projection of a lead which too nearly
approached the delicate profile of a small face might easily
destroy its outline. The glazier&#8217;s lead, it should be explained,
is a wire of about a quarter of an inch diameter, deeply grooved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
on two sides for the insertion of the glass. Imagine the surfaces
exposed to view on each face of the window to be flattened,
and you have a section very much like the letter <b>H</b>, the
uprights representing the flanges, and the cross-bar the &#8220;core,&#8221;
which holds them together and supports the glass mosaic.</p>

<p>The process of painting employed so far is of the simplest; it
consists merely in obscuring the glass with solid paint. This is
laid on with a long-haired pencil or &#8220;tracing brush.&#8221; The paint
itself may be mixed with oil or gum and water, or any medium
which will temporarily attach it to the glass and disappear in
the kiln; for the real fixing of the paint is done solely by the
action of the fire. The pigment employed consists, that is
to say, of per-oxides of iron and manganese ground up with a
sufficient amount of powdered flint-glass or some equivalent
silicate, which by the action of the fire is fused with the glass
(reduced to very nearly red heat), and becomes practically part
and parcel of it.</p>

<p>Whenever a glass painter speaks of painted glass that is
what he means&mdash;viz., that the colour is thus indelibly burnt in.
After the middle of the sixteenth century various metallic
oxides were used to produce various more or less transparent
pigments (enamel colours as they are called to distinguish them
from the pot-metal colours), but in the thirteenth century
transparent enamel colours were as yet unknown to the glass
painter, and he confined himself to the solid deep brown
pigment already spoken of&mdash;an enamel also, strictly speaking,
but by no means to be confounded with the enamel colours of
later centuries. Those were colours used for colour&#8217;s sake;
this is simply an opaque substance used solely on account of its
capacity to stop out so much of the colour of pot-metal glass
as may be necessary in order to define form and give the
drawing of detail; and in effect the brown, when seen against
the light, does not tell as colour at all but merely as so much
blackness. The only colour in the window is the colour of the
various component pieces of glass. Thus in the case of an
early figure (<a href="#Fig_20">page 33</a>) the face would be cut out of a sheet of
pinkish glass and the features painted upon it in brown lines;
each garment would be cut out of the tint it was meant to
be, and the folds of the drapery outlined upon the pot-metal.
In like manner a tree would be cut out of green glass, its stem
perhaps out of brown, and only the forms of the leaves, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
their veining, if any, would be traced in paint. In the execution
of the map there is no occasion for further painting than this
simplest and fittest kind of work, little more than the glazier
would himself have done had his means allowed him. And in the
very earliest glass the painter was almost as sparing of paint as
this: he did, however&mdash;it was inevitable that he should&mdash;use
lines, whether in drawing the features of a face or the folds
of drapery, which were not quite solid, and which consequently
only deepened the colour of the pot-metal, and did not quite
obscure it: he went so far even as to pass a smear of still thinner
colour, a half tint or less, over portions of the glass which he
wished to lower in tone. He began, in fact, however tentatively,
to introduce shading. Happily he was careful always to use
it only as a softening influence in his design, and never to
sacrifice to it anything of the intrinsic beauty and brilliancy of
his glass.</p>

<p>The glass duly painted and burnt, the puzzle would be put
together again on the bench, and bands of lead, grooved at
each side to admit and hold the glass, would be inserted
between the two pieces. These would be soldered together at
the joints where two leads met; a putty-like composition or
&#8220;cement&#8221; would be rubbed into the interstices between lead
and glass to stiffen it, and make it air-and water-tight; and, that
done, the window was finished.</p>

<p>It would only remain (what would in practice have been
done before cementing) to solder to the leads at intervals
sundry loose ends of copper-wire, eventually to be twisted
round the iron saddle bars let into the stone framework of the
window to support it; it would then be ready to be fixed in its
place.</p>

<p>In contradistinction to the mosaic method of execution
adopted by the thirteenth century glazier, a glass painter of
the eighteenth century, and perhaps of the seventeenth,
would, even though there were no necessity for longitudinal
and latitudinal lines, cut up his window into oblong pieces of
convenient size, only, of course, parallel and at right angles
to one another.</p>

<p>The sea he might or might not glaze in blue glass; here
and there perhaps, but not necessarily at all, an occasional
province might be leaded in with a piece of pot-metal; but for
the most part he would use panes of white glass, and rely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
for the colour of the provinces upon enamel. He would have
no need to separate his enamel colours by a line of lead, and
where he wanted a dividing line he would just paint it in
opaque brown. This method of glass painting forms an altogether
separate division of the subject, not yet under discussion.
It is referred to here only by way of contrast, and to emphasise
the fact that, though we are in the habit of using the term
stained glass rather loosely&mdash;though a stained glass window
is almost invariably helped out to some extent by painting
(unless it be what is technically known as &#8220;leaded glass&#8221; or
&#8220;plain glazing&#8221;), and though a painted window is seldom
altogether innocent of glass that is stained&mdash;there are, as
a matter of fact, two methods of producing coloured windows,
the mosaic and the enamelled; and that however customary
it may be to eke out either method by the other more or less,
windows divide themselves into two broad divisions, according
as it is pot-metal or enamel upon which the artist relies for his
effect.</p>

<p>Between these two widely different ideals there are all
manners and all degrees of compromise, and methods were
employed which, to describe at this point, would only complicate
matters. It will be my purpose presently to describe
in detail the steps by which mere glazing developed into
painted glass, and how painting came to supersede glazing;
to show in how far painting was a help to the glazier, and in
how far it was to his hurt; to describe, in short, the progress
of the glass painter&#8217;s art, to better and to worse; and to distinguish,
as far as may be, the principles which govern or
should govern it.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />
<br />
GLAZING.</h3>

<p>The art of the glass painter was at first only the art of the
glazier. To say that may seem like self-contradiction. But
it is not so. On the contrary, it is almost literally the truth;
and it is difficult to find words which would more vividly
express the actual fact.</p>

<p>We are accustomed to think of a painter as using pigment
always in some liquid form, and applying it to wood or plaster,
canvas or paper, with a brush. Should he lay it on with a
palette knife, as he sometimes does, it is painting still. If he
could by any possibility put together his colours in mid-air
without the aid of paper, canvas, or other solid substance, it
would still be painting. This is very much what the worker
in stained glass, by the help of strips of intervening lead,
practically succeeded in doing.</p>

<p>As a painter places side by side dabs of paint, so the glazier
put side by side little pieces of coloured glass. (Glass, you
see, was the medium in which his colour was fixed, just as
oil, varnish, wax, or gum is the vehicle in which the painter&#8217;s
pigment is ordinarily held in suspension.) He could execute
in this way upon the bench or the sloped easel quite an
elaborate pattern in coloured glass; and although, in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
to hold the parts together in a window frame, he had perforce
to resort to some sort of binding, in lead or what not, he may
still reasonably be said, if not actually to have painted in glass,
at all events to have worked in it. In fact, until about the
twelfth century, there were no glass painters, but only glaziers.
Nay, more, it is to glaziers that we owe the glory of the thirteenth
century windows, in which, be it remembered, each separate touch of
colour is represented by a separate piece of glass, and each separate
piece of glass is bounded by a framework of lead connecting it with the
neighbouring pieces, whilst the detail added by the painter goes for not
very much.</p>

<span class="caption">4. <span class="smcap">Arab Window Lattice, Geometric.</span></span>
</div>

<p>No strictly defined, nor indeed any approximate, date can safely be
given at which the art of the glass-worker sprang into existence. Arts
do not spring into existence; they grow, developing themselves in most
cases very slowly. The art of
working in stained glass can only have been the result of a
species of evolution. The germ of it lay in the circumstance
that glass was originally made in comparatively small pieces
(there were no large sheets of glass a thousand years or more
ago), and so it was necessary, in order to glaze any but the
smallest window opening, that these small pieces should be in
some way cemented together. It followed naturally, in days
when art was a matter of every-day concern, the common flower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
of wayside craftsmanship, that the idea of putting these pieces
together in more or less ornamental fashion, should occur to
the workman, since they must be put together somehow; and
so, almost as a matter of course, would be developed the mosaic
of transparent glass, which was undoubtedly the form stained
glass windows first took.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that in some of the earliest windows
the glazing is meant to take the form of tesser√¶; but the
examples instanced in support of that idea afford very little
ground for supposing any such intention on the part of the
first glass-workers. It may more reasonably be presumed
that any resemblance there may be between early glass and
earlier wall mosaic comes of working in the same way; like
methods inevitably lead to like results.</p>

<p>It is by no means certain, even, that the first glaziers
were directly inspired by mosaic, whether of marble or of
opaque glass. They were probably much more immediately
influenced by the work of the enameller.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 134px;">
<a id="Fig_5" name="Fig_5"></a>

<span class="caption">5. <span class="smcap">Arab Lattice, Geometric.</span></span>
</div>

<p>That may appear at the first mention strange, considering
what has been said about the absolute divergence between
mosaic and enamelled glass. But it must be remembered
that enamelling itself among the Lombard Franks, the Merovingians,
and the Anglo-Saxons, was a very different thing
from what the Limousin made it in the sixteenth century.
It was, in fact, a quite different operation, the only point in
common between the two being that they were executed
in vitreous colour upon a metal ground. The enamel referred
to as having probably influenced the early glazier is of the
severer kinds familiar in Byzantine work, and known as <i>champlev√©</i>
and <i>cloisonn√©</i>. In the one, you know, the design is scooped
out of the metal ground, in the other its outline is bent in
flat wire and soldered to the ground. In either case the resulting
cells are filled with coloured paste, which, under the action
of the fire, vitrifies and becomes embodied with the metal.
In <i>champlev√©</i> enamel naturally the metal ground is usually
a distinguishing feature. In <i>cloisonn√©</i> the ground as well as
the pattern is, of course, in enamel; but in either case the
outlines, and, indeed, all drawing lines, are in metal. In <i>cloisonn√©</i>
enamel the metal &#8220;<i>cloisons</i>,&#8221; as they are called, fulfil precisely
the function of the leads in glass windows; and it would have
been more convenient to have left altogether out of account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the sister process, were it not that, in the painting of quite
early glass, the strokes with which the lines of the drapery
and suchlike are rendered, bear quite unmistakable likeness
to the convention of the Byzantine worker in <i>champlev√©</i>. For
that matter, one sees also in very early altar-pieces painted on
wood, where gold is used for marking the folds of drapery, the
very obvious inspiration of Byzantine enamel&mdash;but that is rather
by the way.</p>

<p>The popular idea of an early window is that of a picture, or series of
pictures, very imperfectly rendered. It may much more justly be likened
to a magnified plaque of Byzantine enamel with the light shining through
it. The Byzantine craftsman, or his descendants, at all events, did
produce, in addition to the ordinary opaque enamel, a translucent kind,
in imitation presumably of precious stones; and it might very well be
that it was from thence the glazier first derived the idea of coloured
windows. Quite certainly that was nearer to his thoughts than any form
of painting, as we understand painting nowadays; and, what is more, had
he aimed deliberately at the effect of enamel (as practised in his day),
he could not have got much nearer to it. His proceeding was almost
identical with that of the enamel worker. In place of vitreous pastes he
used glass itself; in place of brass, lead; and, for supplementary
detail, in place of engraved lines, lines traced in paint. Side by side
with the early European window glazing, and most likely before it, there
was practised in the East a form of stained glass window building of
which no mention has yet been made. In the East, also, windows were from
an early date built up of little pieces of coloured glass; but the
Mohammedan law forbidding all attempt at pictorial representation of
animate things, there was no temptation to employ painting; the glazier
could do all he wanted without it. His plan was to pierce small openings
in large slabs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
stone, and in the piercings to set numerous
little jewels of coloured glass. The Romans, by the way, appear also to
have sometimes filled window spaces with slabs of marble framing discs
of coloured glass, but these were comparatively wide apart, more like
separate window-lets, each glazed with its small sheet of coloured
glass. The Oriental windows, on the contrary, were most elaborately
designed, the piercings taking the form of intricate patterns, geometric
or floral. Sometimes the design would include an inscription ingeniously
turned to ornamental use after the manner of the Moorish decorators of
the Alhambra (<a href="#Fig_3">page 15</a>). A further development of the Oriental idea was
to imbed the glass in plaster, a process easy enough before the plaster
had set hard. This kind of thing is common enough in Cairo to this day,
and specimens of it are to be found at the South Kensington Museum.</p>

<p>M. Vogu√© illustrates in his book, <i>La Syrie Centrale</i>, an important
series of windows in the Mosque of Omar (Temple of Jerusalem), erected
in 1528, by Sultan Soliman. The plaster, says M. Vogu√©, was strengthened
by ribs of iron and rods of cane imbedded in the stouter divisions of
the framework, a precaution not necessary in the smaller Cairene
lattices (measuring as a rule about four superficial feet), in which the
pattern is simply scooped out of the half-dry plaster.</p>

<p>The piercings in these Oriental windows and window lattices are not made
at right angles to the slab of stone or plaster, but are cut through at
an angle, varying according to the position and height of the window,
with a view to as little interference as possible with the coloured
light. The glass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
however, being fixed nearest the outside of
the window, there is always both shadow and reflection from the deep
sides of the openings, much to the enhancement of the mellowness and
mystery of colour. In the Temple windows referred to, still further
subtlety of effect is arrived at by an outer screen or lattice of
<i>fa√Øence</i>. Thus subdued and tempered, even crude glass may be turned to
beautiful account.</p>

<p>Whence the medi√¶val Arabs got their glass, and the quality of the
material, are matters of conjecture. If we may judge by the not very
ancient specimens which reach us in this country, the glass used in
Cairene lattices is generally thin and raw; but set, as above described,
in jewels as it were, isolated each in its separate shadow cell, the
poorest material looks rich. The lattices here illustrated are none of
them of very early period; but, where the character of design is so
traditional and changes so slowly, the actual date of the work, always
difficult to determine, matters little.</p>

</div>

<p>It is more than probable, it is almost certain, that the Venetian
glass-workers, who in the tenth century brought their art to France,
were familiar with the coloured lattices of the Levant; for, as we know,
in the middle-ages Venice was the great trading port of Italy, in
constant communication with the East. If that was so, the Italians,
always prone to imitate, would be sure to found their practice, as they
did in other crafts, more or less upon Persian and Arabian models. At
all events, there is every reason to suppose that at first they,
practically speaking, only did in lead what the Eastern artificer did in
stone or plaster, and that the windows which, according to various
trustworthy but vague accounts, adorned the early Christian basilicas as
early as the sixth century, bore strong likeness to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Mohammedan glass&mdash;Christianised, so to speak. This is not to unsay
what was before said about the affinity of early glass to enamel. A
river has not of necessity one only and unmistakable source; and though
we may not be able to trace back through the distant years the very
fountain of this craft, we may quite certainly affirm that its current
was swollen by more than one side-stream, and that its course was shaped
by all manner of obstinate circumstances and conditions of the time,
before it went to join the broad and brimming stream of early medi√¶val
art.</p>

<p>One more source, at least, there was at which the early glazier drew
inspiration&mdash;namely, the art of jewel setting. Coloured glass, as
was said a while ago, was itself probably first made only in imitation
of precious stones, and, being made in small pieces, it had to be set
somewhat in the manner of jewellery. In all probability the enameller
himself wrought at first only in imitation of jewellery, and afterwards
in emulation with it.</p>

<p>Just as white glass was called crystal, and no doubt passed for it, so
coloured glass actually went by the name of ruby, sapphire, emerald, and
so on. It is recorded even (falsely, of course) how sapphires were
ground to powder and mixed with glass to give it its deep blue colour;
indeed, this wilful confusion of terms goes far to explain the mystery
of the monster jewels of which we read in history or the fable which not
so very long ago passed for it. Stories of diamond thrones and emerald
tables seem to lead straight into fairyland; but the glass-worker
explains such fancies, and brings us back again to reality.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind, then, the preciousness of glass, and the well-kept
secrecy with regard to its composition, it is not beyond the bounds of
supposition that the glazier of the dark ages not only intended
deliberately to imitate jewellery, but meant that his glass should pass
with the ignorant (we forget<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> how very ignorant the masses were)
for veritably precious stones.</p>

</div>

<p>Even though we exempt glaziers from all charge of trickery, it was
inevitable that they should attempt to rival the work of the jeweller,
and to do in large what he had done only in small. That certainly they
did, and with such success that, even when it comes to glass of the
twelfth, and, indeed, of the thirteenth century, when already pictorial
considerations begin to enter the mind of the artist, the resemblance is
unmistakable.</p>

<p>Try to describe the effect of an early mosaic window, and you are
compelled to liken it to jewellery. Jewelled is the only term which
expresses it. And the earlier it is the more jewel-like it is in effect.</p>

<p>So long as the workman looked upon his glass as a species of jewellery,
it followed, as a matter of course, from the very estimation in which he
held his material, that he did not think of obscuring it by
paint&mdash;defiling it, as he would have held. It is not so much that
he would have been ashamed to depend on the painter to put his colour
right, as that the thought of such a thing never entered his mind; he
was a glazier. It was the painter first thought of that, and his time
had not yet come.</p>

<p>Possibly it may have occurred to the reader, <i>apropos</i> of the diagram on
<a href="#Fig_2">page 10</a>, in which it was shown how far the glazier could go towards the
production of a map in glass, that that was not far. Certainly he does
not go very far towards making a chart of any geographical value, but he
does go a long way towards making a window; for the first and foremost
qualities in coloured glass are colour and translucency&mdash;and for
translucent colour the glazier, after the glass-maker, is alone
responsible. It is in some respects very much to be deplored that the
Gothic craftsman so early took to the use of supplementary painting,
which in the end diverted his attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> from a possible
development of his craft in a direction not only natural to it but big
with possibilities never to this day realised.</p>

</div>

<p>Of richly jewelled Gothic glass all innocent of paint, no single window
remains to us; but there are fairly numerous examples extant of pattern
windows glazed in white glass, whether in obedience to the Cistercian
rule which forbade colour, or with a view to letting light into the
churches&mdash;and it is to churches, prevalent as domestic glass may
once have been, we must now go for our Gothic windows.</p>

<p>Some of this white pattern work is ascribed to a period almost as early
as that of any glass we know; but it is almost impossible to speak
positively as to the date of anything so extremely simple in its
execution; in which there is no technique of painting to tell tales; and
which, when once &#8220;storied&#8221; windows came into fashion, was probably left
to the tender mercies of lesser craftsmen, who may not have disdained to
save themselves the trouble of design, and to repeat the old, old
patterns.</p>

<p>The earlier glazier, it was said, painted, figuratively speaking, in
glass. It is scarcely a figure of speech to say that he drew in
leadwork.</p>

<p>This mode of draughtsmanship was employed in all strictly mosaic glass;
but it is in the white windows (or the pale green windows, which were
the nearest he could get to white, and which it is convenient to call
white) that this drawing with the leads is most apparent&mdash;in
patterns, that is to say, in which the design is formed entirely by the
leadwork.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

</div>

<p>You have only to look at such patterns as Nos. 11 to 17, to see how this
was so; they are all designed in outline, and the outline is given in
lead. It is perfectly plain there how every separate line the glazier
laid down in charcoal upon his bench stood for a strip of lead. And,
looking at the glass, we see that it is the lead which makes the
pattern. It is no straining of terms to call this designing in the
lead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> The ingenuity in designing such patterns as those <a href="#Fig_11">below</a>
and <a href="#Fig_10">opposite</a>, which is very considerable, consists in so scheming them
that every lead line shall fulfil alike a constructive and an artistic
function; that is to say, that every line in the design shall be
necessary to its artistic effect, that there shall be no lead line which
is not an outline, no outline which is not a lead.</p>

<span class="caption">12. <span class="smcap">Ch√¢lons.</span></span>
</div>

<p>It is not always that the glazier was so conscientious as this. M.
Viollet le Duc pointed out, in the most helpful article in his famous
Dictionary of Architecture, under the head of <i>Vitrail</i>, how in the
little window from Bonlieu, here illustrated, the medi√¶val craftsman
resorted to a dodge, more ingenious than ingenuous, by which he managed
to economise labour. Each separate lead line there does not enclose a
separate piece of glass. The lines are all of lead; but some of them are
mere dummies, strips of metal, holding nothing, carried across the face
of the glass only, and soldered on to the more businesslike leads at
each end. The extent of <i>bon√¢ fide</i> glazing is indicated in the
right-hand corner of the drawing. I confess I was inclined at first to
think that Viollet le Duc might, in ascribing this glass to the twelfth
century, very possibly have dated it too far back; for this is the kind
of trick one would more naturally expect from the later and more
sophisticated workman; but I have since come upon the same device
myself, both at Reims and Ch√¢lons, in work certainly as old as the
thirteenth century. You see, cutting the glass was the difficulty in
those days, and sometimes it was shirked.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 235px;">
<a id="Fig_13" name="Fig_13"></a>

<span class="caption">13.  <span class="smcap">Ch√¢lons.</span></span>
</div>

<p>It should be noted that the subterfuge employed at Bonlieu and in the
specimens from Ch√¢lons, <a href="#Fig_12">opposite</a>, was not in order to evade any
difficulty in glazing&mdash;the designs present none&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
merely to save trouble. There would have been more occasion for evasion
in executing the design from Aix-la-Chapelle (<a href="#Fig_14">14</a>), where the sharp
points of the fleur-de-lys give background shapes difficult for the
glazier to cut. It will be noticed that to the left of the panel one of
the points joins the necking-piece, which holds the fleur-de-lys
together. That is a much more practical piece of glazing than the free
point, which presents a difficulty in cutting the background, indicative
of the late period to which the glass belongs. The earlier medi√¶val
glazier worked with primitive tools, which kept him perforce within the
bounds of simplicity and dignified restraint.</p>

<p>In white windows, so called, he did not by any means
confine himself wholly to the use of what it is convenient to
call &#8220;white glass.&#8221; From a very early date, perhaps from the
very first, he would enrich it with some slight amount of colour.
Having devised, as it were, a lattice of white lines, as in the
left-hand pattern from Salisbury (<a href="#Fig_15">overleaf</a>), it was a very simple
thing to fill here and there a division of his design with a piece
of coloured instead of white glass, as in the pattern next to it in
order. The third pattern, to the right, shows how he would even
introduce a separate jewel of colour, perhaps painted, which had to be
connected with the design by leads forming no part of the pattern.</p>

<p>Colour spots are more ingeniously introduced in the example from
Brabourne Church, Kent, (said to be Norman) where the darker tints are
ingeniously thrown into the background. But here again, although this is
perhaps as early a specimen of glazing as we have in this country, the
glazier resorts in his central rosettes to the aid of paint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">14. <span class="smcap">Aix-la-Chapelle.</span></span></p>

<p>It will be observed that in the marginal lines which frame
this window, and again in the white bands in two out of the
three patterns from Salisbury, leads are introduced which have
only a constructional use, and rather confuse the design. That
they do not absolutely destroy it is due to its marked simplicity,
and to the proportion of the narrow bands to the broad spaces.
This is yet more clearly marked in the very satisfactory glazing
designs from S. Serge at Angers. The fact is, there is a limit
to the possibilities of design, such as that from Sens (<a href="#Fig_52">page 96</a>),
in which literally only four leads (viz., those from the points of
the central diamond shape) are introduced wholly and solely for
strength; and when it comes to windows of any considerable
size, such as clerestory windows, to which plain glazing is peculiarly
suited, leads which merely strengthen become absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
necessary. The art of the designer consists in so scheming them that
they shall not seriously interfere with the pattern.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">15. <span class="smcap">South Transept, Salisbury.</span></span></p>

<p>Were the pattern in lines of colour upon white, the crosslines
strengthening them would of course be lost in the darker tint; but, as
it happens, we do not find in the earliest glazing lines of interlacing
colour, though they occur by way of border lines, as at S. Serge
(<a href="#Fig_17">below</a>), where a marginal line of yellow is enclosed between strips of
white.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 187px;">

<span class="caption">16. <span class="smcap">Brabourne Church Kent.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The interlacing character of several of the white glazing patterns
illustrated betrays of course Romanesque influence; but there would not
have been so many designs consisting of interlacing bands of white upon
a white ground, enclosing, at intervals more or less rare, what had best
be called jewels of colour, had it not been that the forms of
interlacing strapwork lend themselves kindly to glazing.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 236px;">
<a id="Fig_17" name="Fig_17"></a>
<img src="images/fig_17.png" width="236" height="350" alt="S. Serge, Angers" title="S. Serge, Angers" />
<span class="caption">17. <span class="smcap">S. Serge, Angers.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Every time a strap disappears, as it were, behind another, you have just
the break in its continuity which the glazier desires, and if only the
interlacings are frequent enough (as on <a href="#Fig_52">page 96</a>) they give him all he
wants.</p>

<p>So far the examples illustrated are, for the most part, in outline; that
is to say, on a ground of white the
pattern appears as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
network of leads, flowing or geometric as the case may be,
emphasised here and there by a touch of dark colour, focussing
them as it were. Without such points of colour a design
looks sometimes too much like a mere outline, meant to be
filled in with colour, and, in short, unfinished; but as yet
the darker and lighter tints of white are not used to emphasise
the pattern, as they would have done if, for example, the
interlacing straps had been glazed in a slightly purer white
than the ground. On the contrary, notwithstanding the very
great variety in the tints of greenish-white, which resulted from
the chemically imperfect manufacture of the glass, they were
employed very much at haphazard, and so far from ever defining
the design, go to obviate anything harsh or mechanical
there may be in it. There is else, of course, a tendency in
geometric pattern to look too merely geometric. One wants
always to feel it is a window that is there, and not just so many
feet of diaper.</p>

<p>Another practical form of design is that in which it is not
the network of leads, but the spaces they inclose, which constitutes
the pattern; where lines are not so much thought of as
masses; where the main consideration is colour, and contour
is of quite secondary account. The leads fulfil still their artistic
function of marking the division of the colours, as they fulfil
the practical one of binding the bits of coloured glass together;
the glazier still draws in lead lines; but attention is not called
to them especially; indeed, with identically the same lead lines
one could produce two or three quite different effects, according
as one emphasised by stronger colour one series of shapes or
another. In the case of a framework of strictly geometric lines,
straight or curved, one gets patterns such as we see in marble
inlay. The slab of marble mosaic and the stained glass border
<a href="#Fig_18">opposite</a> are more than alike; the one is simply a carrying
further of the other. The glass design might just as well have
been executed in marble, or the marble design in glass. In the
upper church at Assisi are some borders of geometric inlay, one
of which is given on <a href="#Fig_52">page 96</a>, identical in character with the
minute geometric inlay (which, by the way, was also in glass,
though opaque), with which the Cosmati illuminated, so to speak,
their marble shrines and monuments. This species of pattern
work, appropriate as it is to glass mosaic, transparent as well as
opaque, does not seem to have been much used in glass, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
in Italy; where it does occur it is in association, as at Assisi and
Orvieto, with painted work of the thirteenth or fourteenth century,
though from its Byzantine character it might as well be centuries
earlier. It appears that this, which was, theoretically, the simplest
and most obvious form of leaded pattern work, and might, therefore, well
have been the earliest, was never adopted to anything like the extent to
which interlacing ornament was carried.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 169px;">

<span class="caption">18. <span class="smcap">Marble Mosaic, Roman.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Medi√¶val glaziers did not attempt anything like foliated ornament in
leaded glass, and for good reason. In such work the difficulty of doing
without lines detrimental to the design is greatly increased, whereas
abstract forms you can bend to your will, as you can bend your strip of
lead. The more natural the forms employed the more nature has to be
considered in rendering them, and nature declines to go always in the
direction of simple glazing. It might seem easy enough (to those who do
not know the difficulty) to glaze together bits of heart-shaped green
glass for leaves, and red for petals, with a dot of yellow for the eye
of the flower, and to make use of the lead not only for outlines but for
the stalks of the leaves and so on, all on a paler ground; but it is not
so easy as that. The designer cannot go far without wanting other
connecting leads (besides those used for the stalk); and when some leads
are meant very emphatically to be seen and some to be ignored, there is
no knowing what the actual effect may be: the drawing lines may be quite
lost in a network of connecting leads. Again, the medi√¶val glazier did
not, so far as we have any knowledge, build up in lead glazing a boldly
pronounced pattern, light on dark or dark on light.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> This he
might easily have done. On a small scale plain glazing must perforce be
modest; but, given a scale large enough, almost any design in silhouette
can be expressed in plain glazing. You may want in that case plenty of
purely constructional leads, not meant to be seen, or in any case meant
to be ignored; but if the contrast between design and background be only
strong enough (say colour on white or white on colour), they do not in
the least hurt the general effect. On the contrary, they are of the
utmost use to the workman who knows his materials, enabling him to get
that infinite variety of colour which is the crowning charm of glass.</p>

</div>

<p>What the designer of leaded glass had to consider was, in the first
place, the difficulty of shaping the pieces. That is now no longer very
great, thanks to the diamond, which makes cutting so easy that there is
even a danger lest the workman&#8217;s skill of hand may outrun his judgment,
and tempt him to indulge in useless <i>tours de force</i>. The absurdity of
taking the greatest possible pains to the least possible purpose is
obvious. The more important consideration is now, therefore, the
substantiality of the window once made. Think of the force of a gale of
wind and its pressure upon the window: it is tremendous; and glazing
does not long keep a smooth face before it. Except there is a solid iron
bar to keep it in place, it soon bulges inwards, and presents a surface
as undulous, on a smaller scale, as the pavement of St. Mark&#8217;s; and, as
it begins to yield, snap go the awkwardly shaped pieces of glass which
the glazier has been at such pains to cut. The medi√¶val artist,
therefore, exercised no more than common sense, when he shaped the
pieces of glass he employed with a view to security, avoiding sharp
turns or elbows in the glass, or very long and narrow strips, or even
very acutely pointed wedge-shaped pieces. No doubt the difficulty of
cutting helped to keep him in the way he should go; probably, also, he
was under no temptation to indulge in pieces of glass so large that,
incapable of yielding, they were bound to break under pressure of the
wind. That he sometimes used pieces so small as in time to get clogged
with dust and dirt, was owing to the natural desire to use up the
precious fragments which, under his clumsy system of cutting, must have
accumulated in great quantity. Where most he showed his mastery was, in
foreseeing where the strain would come, and introducing always a lead
joint where the crack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> might occur, anticipating and warding off
the danger to come. He was workman enough frankly to accept the
limitations of his trade. Occasionally (as at Bonlieu) he may have
shirked work; but he accommodated himself to the nature of his
materials. Never pretending to do what he could not, he betrayed neither
its weakness nor his own.</p>

<p>Mere <i>glazing</i> has here been discussed at a length which perhaps neither
existing work of the kind nor the modern practice of the craft (more is
the pity) might seem to demand. It is the most modest, the rudest even,
of stained glass; but it is the beginning and the foundation of glass
window making, and it affects most deeply even the fully developed art
of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The leading of a window is the framework of its design, the skeleton to
be filled out presently and clothed in colour; and, if the anatomy is
wrong, nothing will ever make the picture right. The leads are the
bones, which it is necessary to study, even though they were
intrinsically without interest, for on them depends the form which shall
eventually charm us. Beauty is not skin deep: it is the philosophy of
the poet which is shallow.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<br />
EARLY MOSAIC WINDOWS.</h3>

<p>It has been explained already at how very early a period
&#8220;stained&#8221; glass begins also to be &#8220;painted&#8221; glass more or less.</p>

<p>But for the fond desire to be something more than an artist&mdash;to
teach, to preach, to tell a story&mdash;the glazier would possibly
have been quite content with the mere jewellery of glass, and
might have gone on for years, and for generations, using his
pot-metal as it left the pot. As it was, working always in the
service of the Church, in whose eyes it was of much more
importance that a window should be &#8220;storied&#8221; than that it
should be &#8220;richly dight,&#8221; he found it necessary from the first
to adopt the use of paint&mdash;not, as already explained, for the
purpose of giving colour, but of shutting it out, or at most
modifying it. His work was still essentially, and in the first
place, mosaic. He conceived his window, that is to say, as
made up of a multiplicity of little pieces of coloured glass, the
outlines supplied, for the most part, by the strong lines of connecting
leadwork, and the details traced in lines of opaque
pigment. He still designed with the leads, as I have expressed it,
and throughout the thirteenth century (though less emphatically
than in the twelfth) his design is commonly quite legible at a
distance at which the painted detail is altogether lost; but in
designing his leads he had always in view, of course, that they
were to be helped out by paint.</p>

<span class="caption">20. <span class="smcap">Figures from Ascension, Le Mans.</span></span>
</div>

<p>In the late thirteenth century or early fourteenth century
figure from Troyes, on <a href="#Fig_228">page 336</a>, which depends very little indeed
upon any painted detail to be deciphered, the lighter figure
glazed upon a ground of dark trellis-work is not only readable,
but suggestive of considerable feeling; and in the undoubtedly
fourteenth century figure on <a href="#Fig_177">page 241</a>, where, with the exception
of the hands and face, there is absolutely no indication of the
paint with which the artist eventually completed his drawing,
there is no mistaking the recumbent figure of Jesse, even without
any help of colour. But the earlier the glass, the less was there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
of painting, and the more the burden of design fell upon the glazier.
The two figures from Le Mans, here given (generally allowed to belong to
about the year 1100) show very plainly both the amount and the character
of the painting used, and the extent to which the design depends upon
it. There is no mistake about the value of the lead lines there, or the
extreme simplicity of the painted detail.</p>

<p>It will be seen that paint is there used for three purposes: to paint
out the ground round about the feet, hands, and faces; to mark the folds
of the drapery, and just an indication of shading upon it; and to
blacken the hair. It was only in thus rendering the human hair that the
earliest craftsman ever used paint as local colour. In that case he had
a way of scraping out of it lines of light to
indicate detail. If such lines showed too bright, it was easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
to tone them down with a film of thinner paint. In these particular
figures from Le Mans the artist had not yet arrived at that process; but
from the very first it was a quite common custom, instead of painting
very small ornamental detail, to obscure the glass with solid pigment,
and then scrape out the ornament.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<a id="Fig_21" name="Fig_21"></a>
<img src="images/fig_21.png" width="200" height="166" alt="Hitchin Church" title="Hitchin Church" />
<span class="caption">21. <span class="smcap">Hitchin Church.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The fact is, that in early windows a much larger proportion of the glass
is obscured, and had need to be obscured,
than would be supposed. It will be seen what a considerable
area of paint surrounds the feet of the two apostles on <a href="#Fig_20">page 33</a>.
This is partly owing to the then difficulty of exactly shaping
the pieces of glass employed; but it is largely due to the actual
necessity of sufficient area of dark to counteract the tendency
of the lighter shades of glass, such as the brownish-pink
employed for flesh tints, to spread their rays and obliterate the
drawing. Not only would the extremely attenuated fingers,
shown in the scraps from Hitchin Church <a href="#Fig_21">above</a> look quite
well fleshed in the glass, but it was essential that they should
be so painted in order to come out satisfactorily&mdash;that is,
without the aid of shading, to which painters did not yet much
resort. On the contrary, they were at first very chary of half tint&mdash;employing
it, indeed, for the rounding of flesh and so on,
but not to degrade the colour of the glass, small though their
palette was.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 371px;">
<a id="Fig_22" name="Fig_22"></a>
<img src="images/fig_22.png" width="371" height="400" alt="S. Remi, Reims" title="S. Remi, Reims" />
<span class="caption">22. <span class="smcap">S. Remi, Reims.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Something, however, had to be done to prevent especially
the whites, yellows, and pale blues, and in some degree all but
the dark colours, from taking more than their due part in the
general effect. It was not always possible to reduce the area of
the glass of an aggressive tint to the dimensions required. To
have reduced a line of white, for example, to the narrowness at
which it would tell for what was wanted, would have been to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
make it so narrow that the accumulation of dust and dirt
between the leads would soon have clogged it and blotted it out
altogether. What they did was to paint it heavily with pattern.
For example, they would paint out great part of a white line and
leave only a row of beads, with so much paint between and
around them that certainly not more than one-third of the area
of the glass was left clear, and the effect at the right distance
(as at Angers, <a href="#Fig_63">page 116</a>) would be that of a continuous string of
pearls. They would in the same way paint a strip of glass solid,
and merely pick out a zig-zag or some such pattern upon it, with
or without a marginal thread of light on each side (Le Mans).
Rather than lower the brightness of the glass by a tint of
pigment they would coat it with solid brown, and pick out upon
it a minute diaper of cross-hatched lines and dots, by that
means reducing the volume of transmitted light without much
interfering with its purity (S. Remi, Reims, <a href="#Fig_22">below</a>). Diaper of
more interesting kind afforded a ready means of lowering shades
of glass which were too light or too bright for the purpose
required, and for supplying in effect the deficiencies of the pot-metal
palette. Overleaf are some fragments of diaper pattern
so picked out, from Canterbury, which would possibly never have been
devised if the designer had had to his hand just the shade of blue glass
he wanted. Something certainly of the elaboration of pattern which
distinguishes the earliest glass comes of the desire to qualify its
colour. Viollet le Duc endeavours to explain with scientific precision
which are the colours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
which spread most, and how they spread. His analysis is
useful as well as interesting; but absolute definition of the effect
of radiation is possible only with regard to a rigidly fixed range
of colours to which no colourist would ever confine himself. A
man gets by experience to know the value of his colours in their
place, and thinks out his scheme accordingly. He puts, as a
matter of course, more painting into pale draperies than into
dark, and so on; but to a great extent he acts upon that subtle
sort of reasoning which we call feeling. Intuition it may be,
but it is the intuition of a man who knows.</p>

<p>The simple method of early execution went hand in hand with equal
simplicity of design&mdash;the one almost necessitated the
other&mdash;and the earlier the window the more plainly is its pattern
pronounced, light against dark, or, less usually, (as in some most
interesting remains of very early glass from Ch√¢lons now at the <i>Mus√©e
des Arts D√©coratifs</i> at Paris) in full, strong colour upon white. In
twelfth century work especially, figures and ornament alike are
always frankly shown <i>en silhouette</i>. Witness the design on <a href="#Fig_20">pages
33</a> and <a href="#Fig_61">115</a>. Similar relief or isolation of the figure against
the background is shown in the thirteenth century bishops,
occupying two divisions of a rose window at Salisbury, on
<a href="#Fig_185">page 275</a>; and again in the little subject from Lyons, where
S. Peter is being led off by the gaoler to prison.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a id="Fig_23" name="Fig_23"></a>

<span class="caption">23. <span class="smcap">Canterbury Cathedral.</span></span>
</div>

<p>In proportion as the aim of the artist becomes more pictorial
he groups his figures more in clumps (you see indications of
that at Canterbury), whence comes much of the confusion of
effect characteristic of the thirteenth century as it advances,
not in this respect in the direction of improvement. In his
haste to tell a story he tells it less effectively. Where an early
subject is unintelligible (supposing it to be in good preservation)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><br />
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>it is almost invariably owing to the figures not being clearly
enough cut out against the background. Isolation of the design
seems to be a necessary condition of success in glass of the
simple, scarcely painted, kind. In ornament, where the artist
had nothing to think of but artistic effect, he invariably and to
a much later period defined it unmistakably against contrasting
colour. That is illustrated on <a href="#Fig_64">page 117</a>, part of a thirteenth
century window at Salisbury, and in the
border <a href="#Fig_25">below</a>, as well as various others
of the period, <a href="#Fig_73">pages 129</a>, <a href="#Fig_75">130</a>, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>It is the almost unanimous verdict of the inexpert that the lead lines
very seriously detract from the beauty of early windows. How much more
beautiful they would be, it is said, without those ugly black lines!
Possibly the expert and the lover of old glass have unconsciously
brought themselves not to see what they do not want to see; and the
leads may, soberly and judiciously speaking, seriously interfere with
the form of the design. But, in the first place, the beauty of early
glass is in its colour, not in its form. That is very clearly shown in
the illustrations to this chapter and the next; which give,
unfortunately, nothing of the beauty and real glory of the glass, but
only its design and execution; they appear perhaps in black and white so
merely grotesque, that it may be difficult to any one not familiar with
the glass
itself to understand why so much should be said in its praise.
In reality the lack of beauty, especially apparent in the figure
drawing of the early glass painters when reduced to monochrome,
taken in conjunction with the magnificent effect of
many of the earliest windows (which no colourist has ever yet
been known to deny) is proof in itself how entirely their art
depended upon colour&mdash;colour, it should be added, of a quality
quite unapproachable by any other medium than that of translucent
glass or actual jewellery. No one who appreciates at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
anything like its full value the magnificence of that colour will
think the interference of occasional lead lines a heavy price to
pay for it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 271px;">
<a id="Fig_24" name="Fig_24"></a>
<img src="images/fig_24.png" width="271" height="500" alt="Poitiers Cathedral" title="Poitiers Cathedral" />
</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">24. POITIERS CATHEDRAL. (Compare with <a href="#Fig_59">59</a>.)</span></p>

<p>For&mdash;and this is the second point to be explained in reference
to leading&mdash;the leads, were they never so objectionable, are
actually the price we pay for the glory of early glass. It
is by their aid we get those mosaics of pot-metal, the depth
and richness of which to this day, with all our science of
chemistry, we cannot approach by any process of enamelling.
Moreover, though merely constructional leads, taking a direction
contrary to the design, may at times disturb the eye, (they
scarcely ever disturb the effect) they add to the richness of the
glass in a way its unlearned admirers little dream. Not only is
the depth and intensity of the colour very greatly enhanced by
the deep black setting of lead, a veritable network of shade in
which jewels of bright colour are caught, but it is by the
use of a multiplicity of small pieces of glass (instead of a single
sheet, out of which the drapery of a figure could be cut all in
one piece&mdash;the ideal of the ignorant!), that the supreme beauty
of colour is reached. Examine the bloom of a peach or of a
child&#8217;s complexion, and see how it is made up of specks of blue
and grey and purple and yellow amongst the pink and white of
which it is supposed to consist. Every artist, of course, knows
that a colour is beautiful according to the variety in it; and
a &#8220;Ruby&#8221; background (as it is usually called), which is made up
of little bits of glass of various shades of red, not only crimson,
scarlet, and orange, but purple and wine-colour of all shades
from deepest claret to tawny port, is as far beyond what is
possible in a sheet of even red glass as the colour of a lady&#8217;s
hand is beyond the possible competition of pearl powder or
a pink kid glove. Not only, therefore, were the small pieces
of glass in early windows, and the consequent leads, inevitable,
but they are actually at the very root of its beauty;
and the artificer of the dark ages was wiser in his generation
than the children of this era of enlightenment. He did
not butt his head against immovable obstacles, but built
upon them as a foundation. Hence his success, and in it
a lesson to the glazier for all time&mdash;which was taken to heart
(as will be shown presently) by craftsmen even of a period
too readily supposed to have been given over entirely to painting
upon glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Let there be no misunderstanding about what is claimed for the earliest
windows. The method of mosaic, eked out with a minimum of tracing in
opaque pigment, does not lend itself very kindly to picture; and it is
in ornament that the thirteenth century glazier is pre-eminent. There is
even something barbaric about the splendour of his achievement. Might it
not be said that in all absolutely ornamental decoration there is
something of the barbaric?&mdash;which may go to account for the rarity
of real ornament, or any true appreciation of it, among modern people.</p>

</div>

<p>We might not have to scratch the civilised man very deep to reach the
savage in him, but he is, at all events, sophisticated enough to have
lost his unaffected delight in strong bright colours and &#8220;meaningless&#8221;
twistings of ornament. Be that as it may, the figure work of the
thirteenth century window designer is distinctly less perfect than his
scrolls and suchlike, partly, it is true, because of his inadequate
figure drawing, but partly also because his materials were not well
adapted to anything remotely like pictorial representation. The figures
in his subjects have, as before said, to be cut out against the
background in order to be intelligible. Hence a stiff and ultra-formal
scheme of design, and also a certain exaggeration of attitude, which in
the hands of a <i>na√Øve</i> and sometimes almost childish draughtsman becomes
absolutely grotesque. This is most strikingly the case in the larger
figures, sometimes considerably over lifesize, standing all in a row in
the clerestory lights of some of the great French cathedrals.</p>

<p>The scale of these figures gave opportunity (heads all-of-a-piece
show that it did not actually make it a necessity)
for glazing the faces in several pieces of glass; and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
quite the usual thing, as at Lyons (<a href="#Fig_26">opposite</a>) to glaze the flesh
in pinkish-brown, the beard in white or grey or yellow or some
dark colour&mdash;not seldom blue, which had at a distance very
much the value of black&mdash;and the eyes in white. Sometimes
even, as at Reims, the iris of the eye was not represented
by a blot of paint but was itself glazed in blue. The effect
of this might have been happier if the lines of the painting
had been more of the same strength as the leads, and so
strong enough to support them. As it is, the great white eyes
start out of the picture and spoil it. They have a way of glaring
at you fixedly; there is no speculation in their stare; they look
more like huge goggles than live eyes. And it is not these only
which are grotesque; the smaller figures in subject windows
are, for the most part, rude and crude, to a degree which precludes
one, or any one but an arch√¶ologist <i>pur sang</i>, from taking
them seriously as figure design. They are often really not so
much like human figures as &#8220;bogies,&#8221; ugly enough to frighten a
child. What is more to be deplored is that they are so ugly as
actually to have frightened away many a would-be artist in glass
from the study of them&mdash;a study really essential to the proper
understanding of his <i>m√©tier</i>; for repellant as those bogey figures
may be, they show more effectually than later, more attractive,
and much more accomplished painting, the direction in which
the glass painter should go, and must go, if he wants to make
figures tell, say, in the clerestory of a great church.</p>

<p>Apart from the halo of sentiment about the earliest work&mdash;and
who shall say how much of that sentiment we bring to it ourselves?&mdash;apart
from the actual picturesqueness&mdash;and how much
of that is due to age and accident?&mdash;there <i>is</i> in the earliest
glass a feeling for the material and a sense of treatment seldom
found in the work of more accomplished glass painters. If
there is not actually more to be learnt from it than from
later and more consummate workmanship, there is at least no
danger of its teaching a false gospel, as that may do.</p>

<p>From the grossest and most archaic figures, ungainly in form
and fantastic in feature, stiff in pose and extravagant in action,
out of all proportion to their place in the window, there are
at least two invaluable lessons to be learnt&mdash;the value of
broad patches of unexpected colour, interrupting that monotony
of effect to which the best-considered schemes of ornament
incline, and the value of simplicity, directness, and downright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
rigidity of design. Severity of design is essential to largeness
of style; it brings the glass into keeping with the grandeur
of a noble church, into tune with the solemn chords of the
organ. Modern windows may sometimes astound us by their
aggressive cleverness, the old soothe and satisfy at the same
time that they humble the devout admirer.</p>

<p>The confused effect of Early glass (except when the figures
are on a very large scale) is commonly described as &#8220;kaleidoscopic.&#8221;
That is not a very clever description, and it is rather a
misleading one. For, except in the case of the rose or wheel
windows, common in France, Early glass is not designed on the
radiating lines which the kaleidoscope inevitably gives. It is
enough for the casual observer that the effect is made up of
broken bits of bright colour; and if they happen to occupy
a circular space the likeness is complete to him. But to know
the lines on which an Early Gothic window was built, is to
see, through all confusion of effect, the evidence of design, and
to resent the implication of thoughtless mechanism implied in
the word kaleidoscopic. Nevertheless, little as the medi√¶val
glaziers meant it&mdash;they were lavish of the thought they put
into their art&mdash;their glass does often delight us, something as
the toy amuses children, because the first impression it produces
upon us is a sense of colour, in which there is no too
definite form to break the charm. There comes a point in our
satisfaction in mere beauty (to some it comes sooner than to
others&mdash;too soon, perhaps) at which we feel the want of a meaning
in it&mdash;must find one, or our pleasure in it is spoilt; we even go
so far as to put a meaning into it if it is not there; but at first it
is the mysterious which most attracts the imagination.</p>

<p>And even afterwards, when the mystery is solved, we are not
sorry to forget its meaning for a while, to be free to put our
own interpretation upon beauty, or to let it sway us without
asking why, just as we are moved by music which carries us
we know not where, we care not.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.<br />
<br />
PAINTED MOSAIC GLASS.</h3>

<p>The glass so far vaguely spoken of as &#8220;Early&#8221; belongs to the period when
the glazier designed his leads without thinking too much about painting.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 81px;">

<span class="caption">27. <span class="smcap">Chartres.</span></span>
</div>

<p>There followed a period when the workman gave about equal thought to the
glazing and the painting of his window.</p>

<p>Then came a time when he thought first of painting, and glazing was a
secondary consideration with him.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 118px;">

</div>

<p>According as we contemplate glass painting from the earlier or the later
standpoint, from the point of view of glass or of painting, we are sure
to prefer one period to the other, to glory perhaps in the advance of
painting, or to regret the lesser part that coloured glass eventually
plays in the making of a window. To claim for one or the other manner
that it is the true and only way, were to betray the prejudice of the
partizan. Each justifies itself by the masterly work done in it, each is
admirable in its way. It is not until the painter began, as he
eventually did, to take no thought of the glass he was using, and the
way it was going to be glazed, that he can be said with certainty to
have taken the downward road in craftsmanship. We shall come to that
soon enough; meanwhile, throughout the Gothic period at least, he kept
true to a craftsmanlike ideal, and never quite forsook the traditions of
earlier workmanship; and until well into the fourteenth century he
began, we may say, with glazing. In the fourteenth century borders
<a href="#Fig_29">overleaf</a> and in the figure on <a href="#Fig_31">page 47</a>, no less than in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
earlier examples on <a href="#Fig_27">pages 43</a> and <a href="#Fig_30">46</a>, the glazing lines fulfil a
very important part in the design, emphasising the outlines of
the forms, if they do not of themselves form an actual pattern.
Naturally, once the glazier resorted to the use of paint, he
schemed his leads with a view to supplementary painting, and
had always a shrewd idea as to the details he meant to add;
but it will be clear to any one with the least experience in
design that a man might map out the leadwork of such borders
as those shown <a href="#Fig_29">below</a> with only the vaguest idea as to how he
was going to fill them in with paint, and yet be sure of fitting them
with effective foliage. So the architectural canopies on <a href="#Fig_83">pages 134</a>, <a href="#Fig_84">135</a>,
<a href="#Fig_106">154</a>, were pretty surely first blocked out according to their lead lines;
and not till the design was thus mapped out in colour did the designer
begin to draw the detail of his pinnacles and crockets. The invariable
adherence to a traditional type of design made it the easier for him to
keep in mind the detail to come. For he had not so much to imagine as to
remember. He was free, however, always to follow any spontaneous impulse
of design.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 239px;">

<span class="caption">29. <span class="smcap">S. Ouen, Rouen.</span></span>
</div>

<p>It was told in <a href="#Page_32">Chapter IV</a>. how, in the beginning, pigment
was used only to paint out the light, to emphasise drawing,
and to give detail&mdash;such as the features of the face, the
curls of the hair, and so on. That was the ruling idea of
procedure. In practice, however, it is not very easy to paint
perfectly solid lines on glass. At the end of a stroke always,
and whenever the brush is not charged full of colour, the lines
insensibly get thin, not perfectly opaque, that is to say; and so,
in spite of himself, the painter would continually be obtaining
something like translucency&mdash;a tint, in fact, and not a solid brown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Not to have taken advantage of this half tint, would have been
to prove himself something less than a good workman, less than
a reasonable one; and he did from the first help out his drawing
by a smear of paint, more or less in the nature of shading. In
flesh painting of the twelfth century (or attributed to that early
date) there are indications of such shading, used, however, with
great moderation, and only to supplement the strong lines
of solid brown in which the face was mainly drawn. The
features were first very determinedly drawn in line (&#8220;traced&#8221; is
the technical term), and then, by way of shade, a slight scum of
paint was added.</p>

<p>Still, in thirteenth century work, there is frequently no
evidence of such shading; the painter has been quite content
with the traced line. In the fourteenth century a looser kind
of handling is observed. The painter would trace a head in
not quite solid lines of brown, and then strengthen them here
and there with perfectly opaque colour, producing by that means
a much softer quality of line. In any case, the painting until
well into the century was at the best rude, and the half tint, such
as it was, used, one may say, to be smeared on. Here again
practice followed the line of least resistance. It was difficult
with the appliances then in use to paint a gradated tint which
would give the effect of modelling; and accordingly very little
of the kind was attempted. Eventually, however, the painter
began to stipple his smear of shadow, at once softening it and
letting light into it.</p>

<span class="caption">30. <span class="smcap">Salisbury.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Towards the end of the century this stippling process was
carried a step further. It occurred to the workman to coat
his glass all over (or all of it except what was meant to
remain quite clear) with thin brown, and then, with a big dry
brush, dab it until it assumed a granular or stippled surface
(darker or lighter, according to the amount of stippling). This
was not only more translucent than the smeared colour but
more easily graduated, and capable of being so manipulated,
and so softened at the edges, as readily to give a very fair
amount of modelling. This shading was often supplemented
by dark lines or hatchings put in with a brush, as well as by lines
scraped out of the tint to lighten it. But in any case there was
for a while nothing like heavy shading. Even in work belonging
to the fifteenth century, and especially in English glass, as at
York, Cirencester, Ross, &amp;c., it is quite a common thing to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
that the drawing is mainly in line, very delicately done, helped out by
the merest hint of shading in tint. This glass is sometimes a little
flat in effect, and it is not equal in force to contemporary foreign
work; but it is peculiarly refined in execution, and it has qualities of
glass-like sparkle and translucency which more than make amends for any
lack of solidity in painting. Solidity is just the one thing we can best
dispense with in glass.</p>

<p>A comparison of the two borders on <a href="#Fig_25">pages 38</a> and <a href="#Fig_132">175</a>, both German work,
will show how little difference of principle there was between the
thirteenth century craftsman and his immediate successor. The difference
in style between the two is strikingly marked&mdash;the one is quite
Romanesque in character, the detail of the other is comparatively
naturalistic; but when you come to look at the way they are executed,
the way the glazing is mapped out, the way the leads emphasise the
outlines, whilst paint is only used to make out details which lead could
not give&mdash;you will see that the new man has altered his mind more
with regard to what he wants to do in glass than as to how he wants to
do it. Very much might be said with regard to the two figures on <a href="#Fig_30">this
page</a> and the <a href="#Fig_31">opposite</a>. The French designer has departed from the archaic
composition of the earlier Englishman, and put more life and action into
his figure, but there is very little difference in the technique of the
two men, less than appears in the illustrations; for, as it happens, one
drawing aims at giving the lines of the glass, the other at showing its
effect. The fourteenth century figure on <a href="#Fig_35">page 51</a> relies more than these
last upon painting. The folds of the saint&#8217;s tunic, for example, are not
merely traced in outline, but there is some effect of modelling in them.</p>

</div>

<p>It will be instructive also to compare the fourteenth century
hop pattern on <a href="#Fig_130">page 173</a> with the fourteenth century vine on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
<a href="#Fig_245">page 364</a>, and the fifteenth century example on <a href="#Fig_236">page 345</a>. In
the first the method of proceeding is almost as strictly mosaic
as though it had been a scroll of the preceding century. Leaves,
stalks, and fruits are glazed in light colour upon dark, and
bounded by the constructional lines of lead. In the second,
though the main forms are still outlined by the leads, much
greater use is made of paint: the topmost leaf is in one piece of
glass with the stalk of the tree, and all the leaves are relieved
by means of shading. In the third the artist has practically
drawn his vine scroll, and then thought how best he could glaze
it; and the leads come very much as they may.</p>

<p>This last-mentioned proceeding is typical of a period not yet
under discussion, but the second illustrates very fairly the
supplementary use of paint made in the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>A rather unusual but suggestive form of fourteenth century glazing is
shown on <a href="#Fig_135">page 176</a>. It was the almost invariable practice at this period,
as in the preceding centuries, to distinguish the pattern, whether of
scroll or border, by relieving it against a background of contrasting
colour, usually light against dark; but here the border is varicoloured,
without other ground than the opaque pigment used for painting out the
forms of the leaves, etc., and filling in between them. The method lends
itself only to design in which the forms are so closely packed as to
leave not too much ground to be filled in. A fair amount of solid paint
about the leaves and stalks does no harm. A good deal was used in Early
work, and it results in happier effects than when minute bits of
background are laboriously leaded in. The main point is&mdash;and it is
one the early glaziers very carefully observed&mdash;that the glass
through which the light is allowed to come should not be made dirty with
paint. It was mentioned before (<a href="#Page_35">page 35</a>) how, from the first, a
background would be painted solid and a diaper picked out of it. Further
examples of that are shown <a href="#Fig_32">overleaf</a> and on <a href="#Fig_49">pages 88</a> and <a href="#Fig_56">103</a>, though, as
will be seen, a considerable portion of the glass is by this means
obscured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> the effect is still brilliant; and in proportion as
lighter and brighter tints of glass came into use, it became more and
more necessary; in fact, it never died out. The diaper <a href="#Fig_33">opposite</a> belongs
to the fifteenth century, and the minuter of the three diapers <a href="#Fig_32">above</a>, as
well as those on <a href="#Fig_49">pages 88</a> and <a href="#Fig_56">103</a>, belong to the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Now that the reader may be presumed to have a perfectly
clear idea of the process of the early glazier, and to realise the
distinctly mosaic character of old glass, it is time mention
should be made of two important intermediate methods of glass
staining which presently began to affect the character of stained
glass windows.</p>

<p>Allusion has been made (<a href="#Page_2">page 2</a>) to the Roman practice
of making glass in strata of two colours, which they carved
cameo-fashion in imitation of onyx and the like; at least, one
<i>tour de force</i> of this kind is familiar to every one in the famous
Portland vase, in which the outer layer of white glass is in great
part ground away, leaving the design in cameo upon dark blue.
The medi√¶val glass-blower seems from the first to have been
acquainted with this method of coating a sheet of glass with
glass of a different colour. As the Roman coated his dull blue
with opaque white glass, so he coated translucent white with
rich pot-metal colour. It was not a very difficult operation.
He had only to dip his lump of molten white into a pot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
coloured glass, and, according to the quantity of coloured
material adhering to it, so his bubble of glass (and consequently
the sheet into which it was opened out) was spread with a
thinner or thicker skin of colour. The Gothic craftsman took
advantage of this facility, in so far as he had any occasion for its
use. The occasion arose owing to the density of the red glass
he employed, which was such that, if he had made it of the
thickness of the rest of his glass, it would have been practically
opaque. To have made it very much thinner would have been
to make it more fragile; and in any case, it was easier to make
a good job of the glazing when the glass was all pretty much of
a thickness. A layer of red upon white offered a simple and
practical way out of the difficulty.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a id="Fig_33" name="Fig_33"></a>
<img src="images/fig_33.png" width="300" height="222" alt="Diaper scratched out" title="Diaper scratched out" />
<span class="caption">33. <span class="smcap">Diaper scratched out.</span></span>
</div>

<p>What is called &#8220;ruby&#8221; glass, therefore, is not red all through,
but only throughout one half or a third of its thickness. The
colour is only, so to speak, the jam upon the bread; but the
red and the white glass are amalgamated at such a temperature
as to be all but indivisible, to all intents and purposes as
thoroughly one as ordinary pot-metal glass.</p>

<p>For a long while glass painters used this ruby glass and a blue glass
made in the same way precisely as though it had been self-coloured. But
in shaping a piece of ruby glass, especially with their inadequate
appliances, they would be bound sometimes to chip off at the edges
little flakes of red, revealing as many little flaws of white. This
would be sure to suggest, sooner or later, the deliberate grinding away
of the ruby stratum in places where a spot of white was needed smaller
than could conveniently be leaded in. As to the precise date at which
some ingenious artist may first have used this device, it may be left to
arch√¶ology to speculate. It must have been a very laborious process; and
the early medi√¶val ideal of design was not one that offered any great
temptation to resort to it during the thirteenth or even the fourteenth
century. It was not, in fact, until the painting of windows was carried
to a point at which there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> was some difficulty in so scheming the
lines of the lead that they should not in any way mar its delicacy, that
the practice of &#8220;flashing&#8221; glass, as it is termed, became common. That
is why no mention of it has been made till now. It will be seen that it
is a perfectly practical and workmanlike process, rendering possible
effects not otherwise to be got in glass, but lending itself rather to
minuteness of execution and elaboration of detail than to splendour of
colour or breadth of effect.</p>

<span class="caption">34. <span class="smcap">Queen of Sheba, Fairford.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The second intermediate method of staining glass began earlier to affect
the design and execution of windows; and the character of fourteenth
century glass is distinctly modified by it; and, curiously enough,
whilst flashing applied to red and blue glass, this applies to yellow.</p>

<p>It was discovered about the beginning of the fourteenth century that
white glass painted with a solution of silver would take in the kiln a
pure transparent stain of yellow, varying, according to its strength and
the heat of the furnace, from palest lemon to deepest orange. Observe
that this yellow stain is neither an enamel nor a pot-metal colour, but
literally a stain, the only stain used upon glass. In pot-metal the
stain (if it may be so called) is <i>in</i> the glass, this is <i>upon</i> it. But
it is absolutely indelible; it can only be removed with the surface of
the glass itself; time has no more effect upon it than if the glass were
coated with yellow pot-metal. This silver stain was not only of a
singularly pure and delicate colour, compared to which pot-metal yellows
were hot and harsh, but it had all the variety of a wash of
water-colour, shading off by imperceptible degrees from dark to light,
and that so easily that the difficulty would have been in getting a
perfectly flat tint.</p>

<p>Moreover, it could be as readily traced in lines or little touches
of colour as it could be floated on in broad surfaces. By its aid
it was as easy to render the white pearls on a bishop&#8217;s golden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a><br /><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>mitre as to give the golden hair of a white-faced angel, or to
relieve a white figure against a yellow ground&mdash;and all without
the use of intervening lead.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 286px;">

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">35. S. GREGORY, ALL SOULS&#8217; COLLEGE, OXFORD.</span></p>

<p>It is not surprising that such a discovery had a very important effect
upon the development of the glass painter&#8217;s practice. By means of it
were produced extraordinarily beautiful effects, as of gold and silver,
peculiarly characteristic of later Gothic work. The crockets and finials
of white canopies would be touched with it as with gold, the hair of
angels and the crowns of kings; or the nimbus itself would be stained,
the head now being habitually painted on one piece of white glass with
the nimbus. The crown and the pearl-edged head-band of the Queen of
Sheba, from Fairford, (<a href="#Fig_34">page 50</a>), are stained upon the white glass out of
which the head is cut. In the figure of S. Gregory on <a href="#Fig_35">page 51</a> the triple
crown is stained yellow, and so is the nimbus of the bull, whose wings
also are shaded in stain varying from light to dark.</p>

<span class="caption">36. <span class="smcap">Diaper in White and Stain,
All Saints&#8217; Church, York.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Of the elaborate diapering of white drapery, with patterns in rich
stain, more and more resorted to as the fifteenth century advanced, a
specimen is here given, in which the design is figured in white upon a
yellow ground, outlined with a delicately traced line of brown. Stain
was seldom used on white without such outline.</p>

<p>In the end white and stain predominated. Early glass was
likened to jewellery; now the jewels seem to be set in gold and
silver. There was a loss in dignity and grandeur, but there
was a gain in gaiety and brightness. How far stain encouraged
the more abundant use of white glass which prevailed in the
fifteenth century it might be rash to say; at any rate, it
fitted in to perfection with the tendency of the times, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
was ever more and more in the direction of light, until the
later Gothic windows became, in many instances, not so much
coloured windows as windows of white and stain enclosing
panels or pictures in colour. Even in these pictures very
often not more than about one-third of the glass was in rich
colour. And not only was more white glass used, but the white
itself was purer and more silvery, lighter, and at the same
time thinner, giving occasion and excuse for that more delicate
painting which perhaps was one great reason for the change in
its quality. At all events, the more transparent character of the
material necessitated more painting than was desirable in the
case of the hornier texture of the older make. Hence the prevalence
of diaper already referred to.</p>

<p>By the latter half of the fifteenth century painting plays a very
important part in stained glass windows. We have arrived at
a period when it is no longer subsidiary to mosaic; still it has
not yet begun to take precedence of it. The artist is now a
painter, and he relies for much of his effect upon painting; but
he is a glazier, too, and careful to make the most of what glass
can do. He designs invariably with a view to the glazing of
his design, and with full knowledge of what that means.
He knows perfectly well what can be done in glass, and what
cannot. He has not yet carried painting to the perfection to
which it came eventually to be carried, but neither has he begun
to rely upon it for what can best be done in mosaic. He can
scarcely be said to prefer one medium to another; he uses both
to equally workmanlike purpose. He does not, like the early
glazier, design in lead any longer, but neither does he leave the
consideration of leading till after he has designed his picture, as
painters came subsequently to do.</p>

<p>It amounts, it might be thought, to much the same thing
whether the artist begins with his lead lines and works up to
his painting, as at first he did, or begins with his painting and
works up to the leads, as became the practice,&mdash;so long as in
either case he has always in mind the after-process, and works
with a view to it. But the truth seems to be that few men
have ever a thing quite so clearly in their minds as when they
have it in concrete form before their eyes. The glazier may
reckon upon the paint to come, but he does not rely upon
it quite so much as the painter who starts with the idea of
painting.</p>

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">37. <span class="smcap">Nativity, Great Malvern.</span></span></p>

<p>The later Gothic artists gradually got into the way of
thinking more and more of the painting upon their glass.
In the end, they thought of it first, and there resulted from
their doing so quite a different kind of design, apart from
change due to modifications of architectural style; but so long
as the Gothic tradition lasted&mdash;and it survived until well into
the sixteenth century, in work even which bears the brand
of typical Renaissance ornament&mdash;so long the glazing of a
window was in no degree an after-thought, something not
arranged for, which had to be done as best it might. It is
apparent always to the eye at all trained in glass design
that the composition even of the most pictorial subjects was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
very much modified, where it was not actually suggested, by
considerations of glazing. As more and more white glass came
to be used, it was more and more a tax upon the ingenuity of
the designer so to compose his figures that his white should be
conveniently broken up, and the patches of colour he wanted
should be held in place by leads which in no way interfered
with his white glass; for it is clear that, in proportion as the
white was delicately painted, there would be brutality in crossing
it haphazard by strong lines of lead not forming part of
the design; and to the last one of the most interesting things
in medi√¶val design is to observe the foresight with which the
glass-worker plans his colour for the convenience of glazing.</p>

<p>There is very skilful engineering in the subject from Ross on
<a href="#Fig_232">page 339</a>. It is not by accident that the hands of the hooded
figure rest upon the shoulders of S. Edward, or that, together
with his gold-brocaded surcoat and its ermine trimming, his
hands, and the gilt-edged book he holds in them, they fall
into a shape so easy to cut in one piece. Scarcely less artful
is the arrangement of the head of the bishop with his crosier
and the collar of his robe all in one. The glass painter has
only to glance at such subjects as the Nativity from Great
Malvern (<a href="#Fig_37">page 54</a>), or the Day of Creation from the same rich
abbey church (<a href="#Fig_174">page 252</a>), or at the figure of S. Gregory from
All Souls&#8217;, Oxford (<a href="#Fig_35">page 51</a>), to see how the colour is planned
from the beginning, and planned with a view to the disposition
of the lead lines. In the Nativity, which is reproduced from a
faithful tracing of the glass, and is in the nature of a diagram,
the actual map of the glazing is very clear, in spite of its
disfigurement by leads which merely represent mending, and
form no part of the design. There, too, may clearly be seen how
the yellow radiance from the Infant Saviour is on the same
piece of whitish glass on which the figure is painted. In the
Creation and S. Gregory, which are taken from careful water-drawings,
the effect of the glass is given, and it is perceived how
little the leads obtrude themselves upon the observation in the
actual windows.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>The Preaching of S. Bernard from S. Mary&#8217;s, Shrewsbury, <a href="#Fig_38">opposite</a>, is
again disfigured by accidental leads, where the glass <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>has been
repaired; but it will serve to show how, even when lead lines are as
much as possible avoided, they are always allowed for, and even
skilfully schemed. Many of the heads, it will be noticed, are painted
upon the same pieces of white which does duty also for architectural
background; or white draperies are glazed in one piece with the
white-and-yellow flooring; yet the lead lines, as originally designed,
seem to fall quite naturally into the outlines of the figures.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 249px;">

<span class="caption">38. <span class="smcap">S. Bernard Preaching, S. Mary&#8217;s, Shrewsbury.</span></span>
</div>

<p>A very characteristic piece of glazing occurs in the foreground figure,
forming a note of strong colour in the centre of the composition. The
way the man&#8217;s face is included in the same piece of glass with the
yellow groining of the arch, while his coloured cap connects it with his
body, bespeaks a designer most expert in glazing, and intent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> upon it always. The danger in
connection with a device of this kind, very common in work of about the
beginning of the sixteenth century&mdash;as, for example, in the very
fine Flemish glass at Lichfield&mdash;is that, being merely painted upon
a white background, and insufficiently supported by leads, the head may
seem not to belong to the strongly defined, richly draped figure. It is,
of course, very much a question of making the outline strong enough to
keep the leads in countenance. The artist of the Shrewsbury glass adopts
another expedient at once to support the lead lines, to connect his
white and colour, and to get the emphasis of dark touches just where he
feels the want of them. He makes occasional use of solid black by way of
local colour, as may be seen in the hood of the abbess and the shoes of
the men to the right.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 201px;">

<span class="caption">39. <span class="smcap">S. Mary&#8217;s, Shrewsbury.</span></span>
</div>

<p>In another subject from Shrewsbury (<a href="#Fig_39">here given</a>), in the bodice of the
harpist, and the head gear of the figures on <a href="#Fig_57">page 104</a>, effective use is
made of these points of black. So long as they remain mere points, the
end justifies the means, and there is nothing to be said against their
introduction; they are entirely to the good; but such use of solid
pigment is valuable mainly in subjects of quite small size, such as
these are. It would be obviously objectionable if any considerable area
of white glass were thus obscured.</p>

<p>The glass referred to at Shrewsbury, Malvern, and Oxford is
of later date than much work in which painting was carried
further; but there is here no question of style or period; that is
reserved for future consideration (<a href="#Page_111">Book II.</a>). The fact it is here
desired to emphasise is, that there was a time when glazier and
painter took something like equal part in a window, or, to speak
more precisely, there were for a while windows in which the
two took such equal part that each seemed to rely upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the other; when, if the artist was a painter he was a glazier too.
Very likely they were two men. If so, they must have worked
together on equal terms, and without rivalry, neither attempting
to push his cleverness to the front, each regardful of the other,
both working to one end&mdash;which was not a mosaic, nor a painting,
nor a picture, but a window.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<br />
GLASS PAINTING (MEDI√ÜVAL).</h3>

<p>The end of the fifteenth century brings us to the point at
which painting and glazing are most evenly matched, and, in so
far, to the perfection of stained-and-painted glass, but not yet
to the perfection of glass painting. That was reserved for
the sixteenth century, when art was under the influence of the
Renaissance. Glass painting followed always the current
of more modern thought, and drifted picturewards. Even in
the fourteenth century it was seen that there was a fashion
of naturalism in design, in the fifteenth there was an ever-increasing
endeavour to realise natural form, and not natural
form alone; for, in order to make the figure stand out in its
niche, it became necessary to show the vault in perspective.
It was obviously easier to get something like pictorial relief
by means of painting than in mosaic, which accordingly fell by
degrees into subordination, and the reign of the glass painter
began. It must be admitted that at the beginning of the
sixteenth century there was still room for improvement
in painting, and that to the realisation of the then pictorial
ideal stronger painting was actually necessary.</p>

<p>Perhaps the ideal was to blame; but even in Gothic glass,
still severely architecturesque in design, more painting became,
as before said, necessary, as greater use was made of white,
and that painting stronger, in proportion as the material used
became thinner and clearer. But though the aim of the glass
painter was pictorial, the pictorial ideal was not so easily
to be attained in glass; and so, though the painter reigned
supreme, his dominion was not absolute. The glazier was in the
background, it is true, but he was always there, and his influence
is very strongly felt. The pictures of the glass painter are,
consequently, still pictures in glass, for the painter was still
dependent upon pot-metal for the greater part of his colour;
and he knew it, and was wise enough to accept the situation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
and, if he did not actually paint his own glass, to design only
what could, at all events, be translated into glass. He not only
continued to use pot-metal for his colour, but he made every
possible use of it to his end, finding in it resources which
his predecessors had not developed. His range of colours was
extended almost indefinitely, and he used his glass with more
discretion. He took every advantage of the accidental variety
in the glass itself. No sheet of pot-metal was equal in tint from
end to end; it deepened towards the selvedge, and was often
much darker at one end than the other. It ranged perhaps
from ruby to pale pink, from sea-green to smoky-black.</p>

<p>This gradation of tint wisely used was of great service in
giving something like shadow without the aid of paint, and
it was used with great effect&mdash;in the dragons, for example,
which the medi√¶val artist delighted to depict&mdash;as a means
of rendering the lighter tones of the creature&#8217;s belly. Supposing
the beast were red, the glass painter would perhaps
assist the natural inequality of the glass by abrading the ruby,
by which means he could almost model the form in red. If it
were a blue dragon he might adopt the same plan; or, if it were
green, by staining his blue glass at the same time yellow, he
could get every variety of shade from yellow to blue-green.</p>

<p>Every casual variety of colour would be employed to equal
purpose. Even the glass-blower&#8217;s flukes came in most usefully,
not merely, as before, to break the colour of a background
accidentally, but as local colour. Sheets of glass, for example,
which came out, instead of blue or ruby, of some indescribable
tint, streaked and flecked with brighter and darker colour, until
they were like nothing so much as marble, were introduced
with magnificent effect into the pillars of the architecture which
now formed so prominent a feature in window design. The
beauty and fitness of this marble colour is eventually such as
to suggest that the glass-blower must in the end deliberately
have fired at this kind of fluke.</p>

<p>Beautiful as were the effects of white and stain produced
in the middle of the fourteenth century, it was put now to
fuller and more gorgeous use. Draperies were diapered in the
most elaborate fashion; a bishop&#8217;s cope would be as rich as
the gold brocade it imitated; patterns were designed in two
or even three shades of stain, which, in combination with
white and judicious touches of opaque-brown, were really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
magnificent. Occasionally, as at Montmorency&mdash;but this is
rarer&mdash;the painter did not merely introduce his varied stain in
two or three separate shades, nor yet float it on so as to get
accidental variety, but he actually painted in it, modelling his
armour in it, until it had very much the effect of embossed gold.</p>

<p>In some ornamental arabesque, which does duty for canopy
work at Conches, in Normandy, this painting in stain is carried
still further, the high lights being scraped out so as to give
glittering points of white among the yellow. The result of
this is not always very successful; but where it is skilfully
and delicately done nothing could be more brilliantly golden
in effect. It is curious that this silver came to be used in
glass just as goldleaf was used in other decorative painting;
in fact, its appearance is more accurately described as golden
than as yellow, just as the white glass of the sixteenth century
has a quality which inevitably suggests silver.</p>

<p>It was stated just now that blue glass could be stained green.
It is not every kind of glass which takes kindly to the yellow
stain. A glass with much soda in its composition, for example,
seems to resist the action of the silver; but such resistance is
entirely a question of its chemical ingredients, and has only to
do with its colour in so far as that may depend upon them.</p>

<p>Apart from glass of such antipathetic constitution, it is quite
as easy to stain upon coloured glass as upon white; and, if the
coloured glass be not too dark in colour to be affected by it,
precisely the same effect is produced as by a glaze or wash of
yellow in oil or water-colour.</p>

<p>Thus we get blue draperies diapered with green, blue-green
diapered with yellow-green, and purple with olive, in addition
to quite a new development of landscape treatment. A subject
was no longer represented on a background of ruby or dense
blue, but against a pale grey-blue glass, which stood for sky,
and upon it was often a delicately painted landscape, the trees
and distant hills stained to green. Stain was no less useful in
the foreground. By the use of blue glass stained, instead of
pot-metal green, it was easy to sprinkle the green grass with blue
flowers, all without lead.</p>

<p>It was by the combination of stain with abrasion that the
most elaborately varied effects were produced. The painter
could now not only stain his blue glass green (and just so much
of it as he wanted green), but he could abrade the blue, so as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
get both yellow, where the glass was stained, and white where
it was not. Thus on the same piece of glass he could depict
among the grass white daisies and yellow buttercups and bluebells
blue as nature, he could give even the yellow eye of the
daisy and its green calyx; and, by judicious modification of his
stain, he could make the leaves of the flowers a different shade
of green from the grass about them. The drawing of the
flowers and leaves and blades of grass, it need hardly be said,
he would get in the usual way, tracing the outline with brown,
slightly shading with half tint, and painting out only just enough
of the ground to give value to his detail.</p>

<p>In spite of the tediousness of the process, abrasion was now
largely used&mdash;not only for the purpose of getting here and
there a spot of white, as in the eyes of some fiery devil in the
representation of the Last Judgment, but extensively in the form
of diaper work, oftenest in the forms of dots and spots (the
spotted petticoat of the woman taken in adultery in one of the
windows at Arezzo seems happily chosen to show that she is a
woman of the people), but also very frequently in the form of
scroll or arabesque, stained to look like a gold tissue, or even to
represent a garment stiff with embroidery and pearls. Often
the pattern is in gold-and-white upon ruby or deep golden-brown,
or in white-and-gold and green upon blue, and so on.
In heraldry it is no uncommon thing to see the ground abraded
and the charge left in ruby upon white. Sometimes a small
head would be painted upon ruby glass, all of the colour
being abraded except just one jewel in a man&#8217;s cap.</p>

<p>Stain and abrasion, by means of which either of the three
primaries can be got upon white, afford, it will be seen, a workmanlike
way of avoiding leadwork. But there are other ways.
There is a window at Montmorency in which the stigmata in
the hands and foot of S. Francis are represented by spots of
ruby glass inlaid or let into the white flesh, with only a ring of
lead to hold them in place. It would never have occurred
to a fourteenth century glazier to do that. He would have felt
bound to connect that ring of lead with the nearest glazing
lines, at whatever risk of marring his flesh painting; but then,
his painting would not have been so delicate, and would not
in any case have suffered so much.</p>

<p>Indeed, the more delicate painting implies a certain avoidance
of lead lines crossing it, and hence some very difficult feats of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
glazing. This kind of inlaying was never very largely used, but on
occasion not only a spot but even a ring of glass round it would
be let in in this way. There is a window at Bourges in which
the glories of the saints are inlaid with jewels of red, blue,
green, and violet, which have more the effect of jewellery than
if they had been glazed in the usual way. Whether it was
worth the pains is another question.</p>

<p>A more usual, and less excusable, way of getting jewels of
colour upon white glass was actually to anneal them to it. By
abrading the ground it was possible to represent rubies or
sapphires, surrounded by pearls, in a setting of gold, but not
both rubies and sapphires. In order to get this combination
they would cut out little jewels of red and blue, fix them temporarily
in their place, and fire the glass until these smaller (and
thinner) pieces melted on to and almost into it; the fusion, however,
was seldom complete. At this date some of the jewels&mdash;as,
for example, at S. Michael&#8217;s, Spurrier Gate, York&mdash;are usually
missing&mdash;but for which accident one would have been puzzled
to know for certain how this effect was produced. The insecurity
of this process of annealing is inevitable. Glass is in a perpetual
state of contraction and expansion, according to the variation
of our changeable climate. The white glass and the coloured
cannot be relied upon to contract and expand in equal degree;
they are seldom, in fact, truly married. The wedding ring of
lead was safer. Sooner or later incompatibility of temper asserts
itself, and in the course of time they fidget themselves asunder.</p>

<p>All these contrivances to get rid of leads are evidence that the
painter is coming more and more to the front in glass, and that
the glazier is retiring more and more into the background.
The avoidance of glazing follows, as was said, upon ultra-delicacy
of painting, and dependence upon paint follows from
the doing away with leads. We have thus not two new systems
of work, but two manifestations of one idea&mdash;pictorial glass.
The pictorial ideal inspired some of the finest glass painting&mdash;the
windows of William of Marseilles, at Arezzo, to mention
only one instance among many. With the early Renaissance
glass we arrive at masterly drawing, perfection of painting, and
pictorial design, which is yet not incompatible with glass. One
may prefer to it, personally, a more downright kind of work;
but to deny such work its place, and a very high place, in art
is to write oneself down a bigot at the least, if not an ass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
It is not until the painter took to depending upon paint for
strength as well as delicacy of effect, trusting to it for the relief
of his design, that it is quite safe to say he was on the wrong tack.</p>

<p>Towards the sixteenth century much more pronounced effects
of modelling are aimed at, and reached, by the painter. Even
in distinctly Gothic work the flesh is strongly painted, but not
heavily. In flesh painting, at all events, the necessity of keeping
the tone of the glass comparatively light was a safeguard, as
yet, against overpainting.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">40. GUILLAUME DE MONTMORENCY, MONTMORENCY.</span></p>

<p>The actual method of workmanship became less and less
like ordinary oil or water-colour painting. It developed into
a process of rubbing out rather than of laying on pigment.
It was told how the glass painter in place of smear shadow
began to use a stippled tint. The later glass painters made
most characteristic use of &#8220;matt,&#8221; as it was called. Having
traced the outlines of a face, and fixed it in the fire, they
would cover the glass with a uniform matt tint; and, when
it was dry, with a stiff hoghair brush scrub out the lights.
The high lights they would entirely wipe out, the half tints
they would brush partly away, and so get their modelling,
always by a process of eliminating shadow. The conscientious
painter who meant to make sure his delicate tints
would stand would submit this to a rather fierce fire, out of
which would come, perhaps, only the ghost of the face. This
he would strengthen by another matt brushed out in the same
way as before, and fire it again. Possibly it would require a third
painting and a third fire; that would depend upon the combined
strength and delicacy at which he was aiming, and upon the
method of the man. For, though one may indicate the technique
in vogue at a given time, no one will suppose that painters
at any time worked all in the same way. Some men no doubt
could get more out of a single painting than others out of two;
some were daring in their method, some timid; some made
more use than others of the stick for scraping out lines of light;
some depended more upon crisp touches with the sable &#8220;tracer,&#8221;
necessary, in any case, for the more delicate pencilling of the
features; some would venture upon the ticklish operation of
passing a thin wash of colour over matt or stippling before it was
fired, at the risk of undoing all they had done&mdash;and so on, each
man according to his skill and according to his temperament.
But with whatever aid of scratching out lights, or touching in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
darks, or floating on tints, the practice in the sixteenth century
was mainly, by a process of scrubbing lights out of matted or
washed tints of brown, to get very considerable modelling,
especially in flesh painting and in white draperies.</p>

<p>It is impossible in illustrations of the size here given to
exemplify in any adequate manner the technique of the Early
Renaissance glass painters, but it is clear that the man who
painted the small subject from the life of S. Bonnet, in the church
dedicated to that saint at Bourges, (<a href="#Fig_157">page 210</a>) was a painter of
marked power. A still finer example of painting is to be found in
the head of William de Montmorency (<a href="#Fig_40">opposite</a>) from the church
of S. Martin at Montmorency near Paris, really a masterpiece
of portraiture, full of character, and strikingly distinguished in
treatment. There is at the Louvre a painting of the same head
which might well be the original of the glass. If the glass
painter painted the picture he was worthy to rank with the best
painters of his day. If the glass painter only copied it, he was
not far short of that, for his skill is quite remarkable; and the
simple means by which he has rendered such details as the
chain armour and the collar, and the Order of S. Michael,
supplementing the most delicate painting with touches of
opaque colour, which in less skilful hands would have been
brutal, show the master artist in glass painting.</p>

<p>Here, towards the end of the first quarter of the sixteenth
century, we have glass painting carried about as far as it can go,
and yet not straying beyond the limits of what can best be done
in glass. The apologists for the Renaissance would attribute
all such work as this to the new revival. That would be as far
wide of the mark as to claim for it that it was Gothic. The
truth is, there is no marked dividing line between Gothic
and Renaissance. It is only by the character of some perhaps
quite slight monumental or architectural detail that we can
safely classify a window of the early sixteenth century as
belonging to one or the other style. It belongs, in fact, to
neither. It is work of the transition period between the two.
Gothic traditions lingered in the glass painter&#8217;s shop almost
as long as good work continued to be done there; so much
so, that we may almost say that with those Gothic traditions
died the art itself. For all that, it is not to be disputed that
the most brilliant achievements in glass painting were certainly
in the new style and inspired by the new enthusiasm for art.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<br />
GLASS PAINTING (RENAISSANCE).</h3>

<p>The quality <i>par excellence</i> of Renaissance glass was its
painting; its dependence upon paint was its defect. Until
about the middle of the sixteenth century the painter goes on
perfecting himself in his special direction, neglecting, to some
extent, considerations of construction on the one hand, and of
colour upon the other, which cannot with impunity be ignored
in glass, but achieving pictorially such conspicuous success
that there may be question, among all but ardent admirers
of glass that is essentially glass-like, as to whether the loss,
alike in depth and in translucency of colour, as well as of
constructional fitness, may not be fully compensated for by
the gain in fulness of pictorial expression. According as we
value most the qualities of glass in glass, or the qualities of a
picture in no matter what material, will our verdict be. But
there comes a point when the painter so far oversteps the limit
of consistency, so clearly attempts to do in glass what cannot
be done in it, so plainly sacrifices to qualities which he cannot
get the qualities which stained glass offers him, that he ceases
to be any longer working in glass, and is only attempting upon
glass what had very much better have been done in some other
and more congenial medium.</p>

<p>The event goes to prove the seductiveness of the pictorial
idea, and illustrates once more the danger of calling to your
assistance a rival craft, which, by-and-by, may oust you from
your own workshop. The consideration of the possibilities in
the way of pictorial glass is reserved for a chapter by itself. It
concerns us for the moment only in so far as the pictorial
intention affected, as it very seriously did, the technique of
glass painting.</p>

<p>In pursuit of the pictorial the painter strayed from his
allegiance to glass. He learnt to depend upon his manipulation
instead of upon his material; and that facility of his in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
painting led him astray. He not only began to use paint
where before he would, as a matter of course, have glazed-in
coloured glass, but to lay it on so heavily as seriously to detract
from that translucency which is the glory of glass.</p>

<p>It is rash to say, at a glance, whether glass has been too
heavily painted or not. I once made a careful note, in writing,
that certain windows in the church of S. Alpin, at Ch√¢lons,
were over-painted. After a lapse of two or three years I made
another equally careful note to the effect that they were thin,
and wanted stronger painting. It was not until, determined to
solve the mystery of these contradictory memoranda, I went
a third time to Ch√¢lons, that I discovered, that with the light
shining full upon them the windows were thin, that by a dull
light they were heavy, and that by a certain just sufficiently
subdued light they were all that could be desired. There is
indiscretion, at least, in painting in such a key that only one
particular light does justice to your work; but the artist in
glass is always very much at the mercy of chance in this
respect. He cannot choose the light in which his work shall
be seen, and the painter of Ch√¢lons may have been more unfortunate
than in any way to blame. There comes, however, a
degree of heaviness in painted glass about which there can be
no discussion. When the paint is laid on so thick that under
ordinary conditions of light the glass is obscure, or when it is
so heavy that the light necessary to illuminate it is more than
is good for the rest of the window, the bounds of moderation
have surely been passed. And in the latter half of the sixteenth
century it was less and less the custom to take heed of
considerations other than pictorial; so that by degrees the
translucency of glass was sacrificed habitually to strength of
effect depending not so much upon colour, which is the strength
of glass, as upon the relief obtained by shadow&mdash;just the one
quality not to be obtained in glass painting. For the quality
of shadow depends upon its transparency; and shadow painted
upon glass, through which the light is to come, must needs be
obscure, must lack, in proportion as it is dark, the mysterious
quality of light in darkness, which is the charm of shadow.
The misuse of shading which eventually prevailed may best be
explained by reference to its beginnings, already in the first
half of the century, when most consummate work was yet being
done. For example, in the masterpieces of Bernard van Orley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
at S. Gudule, Brussels&mdash;one of which is illustrated <a href="#Fig_42">overleaf</a>;
it is a mere diagram, giving no idea of the splendour of the
glass, but it is enough to serve our purpose.</p>

<p>The execution of the window is, in its kind, equal to the
breadth and dignity of the design. The painter has done, if
not quite all that he proposed to do, all that was possible
in paint upon glass. Any fault to find in him, then, must
be with what he meant to do, not what he did. To speak
justly, there is no fault to find with any one, but only with the
condition of things. We have here, associated with the glass
painter, a more famous artist, the greatest of his time in Flanders,
pupil of Michael Angelo, court painter, and otherwise distinguished.
It was not to be expected that he should be learned
in all the wisdom of the glass painter, nor yet, human nature
being what it is, that he should submit himself, lowly and
reverently, to the man better acquainted with the capacities
of glass. All that the glass painter could do was to translate
the design of the master into glass as best he might, not
perhaps as best he could have done had there been no great
master to consult in the matter.</p>

<p>This was not the first time, by any means, that the designer
and painter of a window were two men. There is no saying how
soon that much subdivision of labour entered the glass worker&#8217;s
shop; but so long as they were both practical men, versed each
in his art, and, to some extent, each in the technique of the
other, it did not so much matter. When the painter from
outside was called in to design, it mattered everything. What
could he be expected to care for technique other than his own?
What did he know about it? He was only an amateur so
far as glass was concerned; and his influence made against
workmanlikeness. He may have done marvels; he did marvels;
but his very mastery made things worse. He bore himself so
superbly that it was not seen what dangerous ground he trod
on. Lesser men must needs all stumble along in his footsteps,
until they fell; and in their fall they dragged their art with
them.</p>

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">41. <span class="smcap">Mosaic Glass, Arezzo.</span></span></p>

<p>The fault inherent in such work as the Brussels windows is
neither Van Orley&#8217;s nor the glass painter&#8217;s; it is in the mistaken
aim of the designer striving less for colour in his windows than
for relief. He succeeds in getting quite extraordinary relief, but
at the expense of colour, which in glass is the most important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
thing. The figures in the window illustrated are so strongly
painted that even the white portions of their drapery stand out
in dark relief against the pale grey sky. That is not done, you
may be sure, without considerable sacrifice of the light-giving
quality of the glass. It is at a similar cost that the white-and-gold
architecture stands out in almost the solidity of actual
stone against the plain white diamond panes above, giving very
much the false impression that it is placed in the window, and
that you see through its arches and behind it into space.
Another very striking thing in the composition is the telling
mass of shadow on the soffit of the central arch. It produces
its effect, and a very strong one. The festoons of yellow arabesque
hanging in front of it tell out against it like beaten gold,
and the rather poorish grey-blue background to the figures
beneath it has by comparison an almost atmospheric quality.
It is all very skilfully planned as light and dark; but there is
absolutely no reason why that shadow should have been produced
by heavy paint. Under certain conditions of light there
are, it is true, gleams of light amidst this shadow. You can
make out that the roof is coffered, and can perceive just a glow
of warm colour; but most days and most of the day it is dead,
dull, lifeless, colourless. The points to note are: (1) that this
painted shadow must of necessity be dull; and (2) that on work
of this scale at all events (the figures here are very much over
lifesize), this abandonment of the mosaic method was not in the
slightest degree called for. On the contrary, the simpler, easier,
and more workmanlike thing to do would have been to glaze-in
the shadow with deep rich pot-metal glass. That was done in
earlier glass, and in glass of about the same period as this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 337px;">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
For example, at Li√®ge, where there are beautiful windows of
about the same period, very similar in design, the glass is altogether
lighter and more brilliant, partly owing to the use of paint
with a much lighter hand, but yet more to greater reliance upon
pot-metal. In the Church of S. Jacques, as at S. Gudule, there
are arched canopies with festoons in bright relief against a background
of shadowed soffit; but there the shadow is obtained
by glazing-in pot-metal, which has all the necessary depth, and is
yet luminous and full of colour.</p>

<p>So also the deeply shadowed architectural background to the
representation of the Daughter of Herodias dancing before
Herod, in the Church of S. Vincent, at Rouen (<a href="#Fig_44">overleaf</a>), is
leaded up in deep purple glass, through which you get peeps of
distant atmospheric blue beyond. And this was quite a common
practice among French glass painters of the early half of the
sixteenth century&mdash;as at Auch, at Ecouen, at Beauvais, at
Conches, where the architecture in shadow is leaded in shades
of purple or purplish glass, which leave little for the painter
to do upon the pot-metal. At Freiburg, in Germany, there is
a window designed on lines very similar indeed to Van Orley&#8217;s
work, in which the shadowed parts are glazed in shades of deep
blue and purple. In Italy it was the custom, already in the
fifteenth century, to lead-in deep shadows in pot-metal; and
they did not readily depart from it. Surely that is the way to
get strong effects, and not by paint. You may take it as a test
of workmanlike treatment, that the darks have been glazed-in,
where it was possible, and not merely painted upon the glass.</p>

<p>There is some misconception about what is called Renaissance
glass. Glass painting was not native to Italy, and was never
thoroughly acclimatised there, any more than Gothic architecture,
to which it was&mdash;the handmaid I was going to say, but
better say the standard-bearer. Much glass was accordingly
executed in Italy in defiance, not only of all tradition, but of all
consistency and self-restraint. But even in Italy you will find
sixteenth century glass as workmanlike as can be. The details
from Arezzo and Bologna, <a href="#Fig_41">above</a>, <a href="#Fig_44">overleaf</a>, and on <a href="#Fig_180">page 266</a>, are
pronouncedly Renaissance in type, but the method employed by
the glass painter is as thoroughly mosaic as though he had
worked in the thirteenth century. Not less glazier-like in treatment
are the French Renaissance details from Rouen, on <a href="#Fig_45">pages
75</a> and <a href="#Fig_237">347</a>, from which it may be seen that a workmanlike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
treatment of glass was not confined to Gothic glaziers. It was
less a question of style, in the historic sense, than of the men&#8217;s
acquaintance with the traditions of good work, and their readiness
to accept the situation.</p>

<p>Possibly the Netherlandish love of light and shade&mdash;and
especially of shade&mdash;may account for the character of the
Brussels glass. Against that it should be said that, elsewhere
in Flanders, splendid glass was being done about the same time,
less open to the charge of being too heavily painted&mdash;at Li√®ge,
for example. But everywhere, and perhaps more than anywhere
in the Netherlands, which became presently a great centre of
glass painting, the tendency, towards the latter part of the
century, was in the direction of undue reliance upon paint; of
which came inevitably one of two things&mdash;either the shaded
parts were heavy, dirty, and opaque, or they were weak and
washy in effect. If, by means of painting, an artist can get (as
he can) something worth getting not otherwise to be got, though
we may differ as to the relative value of what he gains and what
he sacrifices, it would be hard to deny him his preference, and
his right to follow it; but if by painting on glass he attempts
to get what could better be expressed by working in it, then
clearly he has strayed (as Van Orley did) from the straight
path, as glass-workers read the map.</p>

<p>It is rather a curious thing that the avoidance of leading, the
dependence upon glazing and paint, should manifest itself especially in
windows designed on such a scale that it would have been quite easy to
get all that was got in paint, and more, by the introduction of coloured
glass; in windows, for example, on the scale of those at King&#8217;s College,
Cambridge, with figures much over lifesize, where the artist, you can
see, has been afraid of leading, and has shirked it. Evidently he did
not realise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><br /><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> for
how little the leads would count in the glass. He
does not in that case fall into the error of painting with too heavy a
hand, but he trusts too much to paint&mdash;a trust so little founded
that the paint has oftentimes perished, much to the disfigurement of his
picture.</p>

<p>The French glass painters of about the same period, though working upon
a smaller scale, did not depart in the same way from the use of glazing;
and where they did resort to painting, it was often with a view to a
refinement of detail not otherwise to be obtained, as in the case of the
delicate landscape backgrounds painted upon pale blue, which have a
beauty all their own.</p>

<p>There is here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> no intention whatever of disparaging
such work as that at S. Gudule. Any one capable of appreciating what is
strongest and most delicate in glass must have had such keen delight in
them that there is something almost like ingratitude in saying anything
of them but what is in their praise. But the truth remains. Here is a
branching off from old use; here the painter begins to wander from the
path, and to lead after him generations of glass painters to come. It
takes, perhaps, genius to lead men hopelessly astray!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<br />
ENAMEL PAINTING.</h3>

<p>The excessive use of opaque paint was not so much a new
departure as the exaggeration of a tendency which had grown
with the growth of glass painting itself. The really new thing
in glass painting about this time was the introduction of enamel.</p>

<p>When glass painters were resorting, not only to opaque painting,
but to abrasion, annealing, or whatever would relieve them
from the difficulty of getting in mosaic glass the pictorial effect
which was more and more their ruling thought, when glazing
had become to them a difficulty (to the early glass-workers it
was a resource), it was inevitable that they should think about
painting on glass in colour. Accordingly towards the middle
of the sixteenth century they began to use enamel. This was
the decisive turning-point of the art.</p>

<p>In theory the process of painting in enamel is simple enough.
You have only to grind coloured glass to impalpable dust, mix
it with &#8220;fat oil,&#8221; or gum-and-water, and paint with it upon
white or tinted glass; in the furnace the medium will be fired
away, and the particles of coloured glass will melt and adhere,
more or less firmly, to the heated sheet of glass to which they
have been applied. This theory glass painters began to put
into practice. In the beginning they used enamel only tentatively,
first of all in the flesh tints. It had been the custom
since the fourteenth century to paint flesh always upon white or
whitish glass in the ordinary brown pigment; and something
of the simple dignity and monumental character of old glass is
due, no doubt, to that and similar removedness from nature.
Gradually the fashion was introduced of painting the flesh in
red instead of brown. In one sense this was no such very new
thing to do. The ordinary brown pigment spoken of all along
is itself enamel, although it has been thought better not to speak
of it by that name for fear of confusion. Inasmuch, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
as this was the use of a pigment to get not merely flesh painting
but flesh tint&mdash;that is to say, colour&mdash;it was a step in quite a
new direction. Pictorially it offered considerable advantages
to the painter. He could not only get, without lead, contrast
of colour between a head and the white ground upon which it
was painted, or the white drapery about it, but he could very
readily give the effect of white hair or beard in contrast to ruddy
flesh, and so on. There is a fragment at the <i>Mus√©e des Arts
D√©coratifs</i> at Paris, attributed to Jean Cousin, 1531, in which
a turbaned head appears to have been cut out of a piece of
purplish-blue glass, the flesh abraded, and then painted in red,
the lips still redder, whilst the beard is painted on the blue,
which shades off into the cheeks in the most realistic manner.
Very clever things were done in this way, always in the realistic
direction; but down to the middle of the century, and even
later, there were always some painters who remained faithful
to the traditional cool brown colour. A rather happy mean
between warm and cold flesh is found at Auch (1513), where
warmish enamel upon grey-blue or greenish glass gives modelling
and variety of colour in the flesh, which is yet never hot.
Well-chosen pieces of glass are made use of, in which the darker
half comes in happily for the bearded part of a man&#8217;s face. So,
also, the head of the Virgin at the foot of the cross is painted
upon grey, which tells as such in her coif, shaded with a cooler
brown, but only deepens and saddens her face, and intensifies
the contrast with the Magdalen. Occasionally one of these
heads comes out too blue, but at the worst it is better than
the hot, foxy flesh painting which became the rule.</p>

<p>Painting in colour upon glass could naturally not stop at flesh
red. It was used for pale blue skies, at first only to get a more
delicate gradation from pale pot-metal colour to white, but
eventually for the sky throughout the picture. In connection
with yellow stain it gave a green for distant landscape.</p>

<p>Enamel was used in ornament to give the colour of fruits and flowers in
garlands and the like, and generally for elaboration of detail, which,
if not trivial, was of small account in serious decoration. For a while
there were glass painters who remained proof against its seduction. It
was not till the latter half of the sixteenth century that glass
painters generally began seriously to substitute enamel for pot-metal,
and to rely upon paint, translucent as well as opaque. Even then
they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> could not do without pot-metal, avoid it as they might. The
really strong men, such as the Crabeth Brothers, at Gouda, by no means
abandoned the old method, but they relied so much upon paint as to
greatly obscure the glory of their glass. The Gouda windows, which bring
us to the seventeenth century, contain among them the most daring things
in glass extant. They prove that a subject can be rendered more
pictorially than one would have conceived to be possible in glass, but
they show also what cannot be done in it; in fact, they may be said to
indicate, as nearly as can be, the limits of the practicable. What
artists of this calibre could not do we may safely pronounce to be
beyond the scope of glass painting, even with the aid of enamel.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 204px;">

<span class="caption">46. <span class="smcap">The Baptism, Gouda.</span></span>
</div>

<p>No skill of painting could make otherwise than dull the masses of
heavily painted white glass employed to represent the deep shade of the
receding architecture in the upper part of the window on <a href="#Fig_172">page 242</a>; so,
the mass of masonry which serves in the lower half of the window on this
page as a background to the Donor and his patron saint and some shields
of arms, represented as it is by a thick scum of brown paint, could not
but lack lustre. Think of the extent of all that uninteresting paint;
what a sacrifice it means of colour and translucency!</p>

<p>Enamel painting did not lead to much. The colours obtained
by that means had neither the purity nor the richness and
volume of pot-metal. They had to be strengthened with brown,
which still further dulled them; and, the taste for light and
shade predominating as it did in the seventeenth century, the
glass painter was eventually lured to the destruction of all glass-like
quality in his glass.</p>

<p>There are some windows in the cathedral at Brussels, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
chapel opposite that of the Holy Sacrament, where are Van
Orley&#8217;s windows, which bear witness to the terrible decline that
had taken place during something like a century&mdash;not that they
are badly executed in their way. The texture of silk, for example,
is given by the glass painter perfectly; but, in the struggle for
picturesque effects of light and shade, all consistency of treatment
is abandoned. The painter is here let loose; and he can
no more withstand the attractions of paint than a boy can resist
the temptation of fresh fallen snow. The one must throw snowballs
at somebody, the other must lay about him with pigment.
Here he lays about him with it recklessly. He is reckless, that
is, of the obscurity of the glass he covers with it. At moments,
when the sun shines fiercely upon it, you dimly see what he was
aiming at; nine-tenths of the time all is blackness. Slabs of
white glass are coated literally by the yard with dense brown
pigment through which the light rarely shines.</p>

<p>It had become the practice now to glaze a window mainly in
rectangular panes of considerable size. Where pot-metal colour
was used at all, it had of necessity to be surrounded with a
leaden line; but within the area of the coloured mass the leading
was usually in these upright and horizontal lines, and not at all
according to the folds of the drapery or what not. If the
glazier went out of his way to take a lead line round a face,
instead of across it, that was as much as he would do; if it was
merely the face of a cherub, however delicately painted, he
would, perhaps, as at S. Jacques, Antwerp, cut brutally across
it; and even where structural lead lines compelled him to use
separate pieces of material, he by no means always took advantage
of the opportunity of getting colour in his glass, but, as at
Antwerp, contentedly accepted his rectangular panes of white,
as something to paint on&mdash;to the exclusion of no matter how
much light. It simplified matters, no doubt, for the painter
thus to throw away opportunities, and just depend upon his
brush; but it resulted at the best only in an imitation of oil
painting, lacking the qualities of oil paint.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 408px;">

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">47. <span class="smcap">S. Martin √®s Vignes, Troyes.</span></span></p>

<p>The French glass painters were less reckless. At Troyes,
indeed, there is plenty of seventeenth century glass in which a
workman can still find considerable interest. That of Linard
Gontier, in particular, has deservedly a great reputation. He
was a painter who could get with a wash of colour, and
seemingly with ease, effects which most glass painters could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
only get at by stippling, hatching, and picking out; and he
managed his enamel very cleverly, floating it on with great
dexterity. But it is rarely that he gets what artists would call
colour out of it. Even in the hands of a man of his prodigious
skill the method proclaims its inherent weakness. The work
is thinner, duller, altogether poorer, than the earlier glass of
much less consummate workmen, who worked upon sounder
and severer principles. The strength and the weakness of
the painter are exemplified in the group of Donors <a href="#Fig_47">above</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
The painting is admirable, not only in the heads, but in the
texture of the men&#8217;s cloaks; those cloaks, however, are painted
in black paint. When the light is quite favourable they look
like velvet; they never look like glass.</p>

<p>There is here the excuse, for what it may be worth, of
texture and perhaps other pictorial qualities. Even that is often
wanting in seventeenth century work, as when, at S. Jacques,
Antwerp, the background to a design in white and stain is
glazed in panes of white glass solidly coated with brown paint.
This is obscuration out of pure wilfulness.</p>

<p>It was not only when the artist sought to get strong effects
in enamel painting that the method fell short of success. The
delicacy that might be got by means of it was neutralised by
the necessity of some sort of glazing, and matters were not
mended by glazing the windows in panes. It is impossible to
take much satisfaction in the most delicately painted glass
picture when it is so scored over with coarse black lines of lead
or iron that it is as if you were looking at it through a grill.
That is very much the effect seen in Sir Joshua Reynolds&#8217;
famous window in the ante-chapel at New College, Oxford
(two lights of which are shown <a href="#Fig_48">opposite</a>), where the Virtues
are seen imprisoned, you may say, within iron bars. They look
very much better there than in the glass, which, for all the
graceful draughtsmanship of the artist and the delicate workmanship
of the painter, is ineffective to the last degree. It has
no more brilliancy or sparkle than a huge engraving seen
against the light; square feet of white glass are muddied over
with paint.</p>

<p>It was not Sir Joshua&#8217;s fault, of course, that the traditions
of the glazier&#8217;s craft were in his day well-nigh extinct; but
Sir Horace Walpole was quite right when he described these
vaunted Virtues as &#8220;washy.&#8221; To say that they are infinitely
more pleasing in the artist&#8217;s designs is the strongest condemnation
of the glass.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">48. VIRTUES, BY SIR J. REYNOLDS, NEW COLL., OXFORD.</span></p>

<p>There was one use made of enamel which promised to be of
real help to the glazier&mdash;that of painting the necessary shadows
on pot-metal in shades of the same colour as the glass. Since
enamel of some kind had to be used, why not employ a colour
more akin to the glass itself than mere brown? It would seem
as if by so doing one might get depth of colour with less danger
of heaviness than by the use of brown; but the glass painted in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><br /><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>that way (by the Van Lingen, for example, a family of Flemings
established in England, whose work may be seen at Wadham
and Balliol Colleges, Oxford) was by no means free from
heaviness. Enamel then, it will be seen, was never really of
any great use in glass painting, and it led to the degradation
of the art to something very much like the painting of transparencies,
as they are called, on linen blinds.</p>

<p>Let us note categorically the objections to it. A glazier
objects to it, that it is an evasion of the difficulty of working in
glass, and not a frank solution of it. That may be sentimental
more or less. A colourist objects to it, because it is impossible
to get in it the depth and richness of strong pot-metal, or the
brilliancy of the more delicate shades of self-coloured material.
That, it may be urged, remains to be proved, but the enamel
painter practically undertook to prove the contrary, and failed.
Admirers of consistency object to it, that it succeeds so ill in
reconciling the delicacy of painting aimed at with the brutality
of the glazing employed. That, again, is a question of artistic
appreciation, not so easily proved to those who do not feel the
discord. Lovers of good work, of work that will stand, object to
it that it is not lasting. This is a point that can be easily proved.</p>

<p>The process of enamel painting has been explained above
(<a href="#Page_77">page 77</a>). The one thing necessary to the safe performance
of the operation is that the various glass pigments shall be of
such consistency as to melt at a lower temperature than the
glass on which they are painted. That, of course, must keep its
shape in the kiln, or all would be spoilt. The melting of the
pigment is, as a matter of fact, made easier by the admixture
of some substance less unyielding than glass itself&mdash;such as
borax&mdash;to make it flow. This &#8220;flux,&#8221; as it is called, makes the
glass with which it is mixed appreciably softer than the glass to
which it is apparently quite safely fixed by the fire. It is thus
more susceptible to the action of the atmosphere; it does not contract
and expand equally with that; and in the course of time,
perhaps no very long time, it scales off. Excepting in Swiss work
(to which reference is made in <a href="#Page_87">Chapter IX</a>.) this is so commonly
so, that you may usually detect the use of enamel by the specks
of white among the colour, where the pigment has worked itself
free, altogether to the destruction of pictorial illusion. And
it is not only with transparent enamel that this happens, but
also with the brown used by the later painters for shading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
The brown tracing and painting colour was originally a hard
metallic colour which required intense heat to make it flow. The
glass had to be made almost red-hot, at which great heat there
was always a possibility that the pigment might be fired away
altogether, and the painter&#8217;s labour lost. In the case of the
thirteenth century painter&#8217;s work the danger was not very
serious. Thanks to the downright and sometimes even brutal
way in which he was accustomed to lay on the paint, solidly
and without subtlety of shade, his work was pretty well able to
take care of itself in the kiln. It was the more delicate painting
which was most in danger of being burnt away; and in
proportion as men learnt to carry their painting further, and
to get delicate modelling, they became increasingly anxious to
avoid all possibility of any such catastrophe. The easiest way
of doing this was (as in the case of transparent enamel) to
soften this colour with flux. That enabled them to fire their
glass at a much lower heat, at which there was no risk of losing
the painting, and they were able so to make sure of getting the
soft gradations of shade they wanted; and the more the painter
strove to get pictorial effects the more he was tempted to soften
his pigment; but, according as the flux made the colour easier
to manage in the fire, it made it less to be depended upon
afterwards; and the later the work, and the more pictorial its
character, the more surely the painting proves at this date to
have lost its hold upon the glass. In many a seventeenth
century window the Donors were depicted in their Sunday suits
of black velvet and fur, the texture quite wonderfully given;
now their garments are very much the worse for wear, more
than threadbare. The black or brown is rich no longer, it is
pitted with specks of raw white light; sometimes the colour has
peeled off <i>en masse</i>. Time has dealt comparatively kindly with
the gentlemen on <a href="#Fig_47">page 81</a>, but in the glass there is an air of
decay about their sable cloaks which takes considerably
away from their dignity. It is one characteristic of enamelled
windows that they do not mellow with age, like mosaic glass,
but only get shabby.</p>

<p>Any one altogether unacquainted with the characteristics of
style is apt to be very much at fault as to the date of a
window. The later windows are in so much more dilapidated
a condition than the earlier that they are quite commonly mistaken
for the older.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
It has to be borne in mind that most of the devices adopted
by the glass painters&mdash;the use, namely, of large sheets of fragile
glass, and the avoidance of strengthening leads, no less than the
resort to soft enamel, whether for colour or for shading&mdash;all
go to make it more perishable.</p>

<p>It may be said that the decay of the later painting is due not
so much to the use of enamel as to the employment of soft flux.
That is true. But when it comes to the painting of texture
and the like, the temptation to use soft colour has generally
proved to be irresistible. One is forced to the conclusion that
the aim of the later glass painter was entirely wrong; that for
the sake of pictorial advantages&mdash;which went for very little in
a scheme of effective church decoration, even if they did not
always detract from the breadth of the work&mdash;he gave up the
qualities which go at once to make glass glorious, and to give it
permanence. Whatever the merits of seventeenth century
glass painting they are not the merits of glass; there is little
about it that counts for glass, little that is suggestive of glass&mdash;except
the breakages it has suffered.</p>

<p>What is said of seventeenth century glass applies also to that
of the eighteenth century, only with more force. Sir Joshua
and Benjamin West were quite helpless to raise the art out of
the slough into which it had fallen, for they were themselves
ignorant of its technique, and did not know what could be done
in glass. It was not until the Gothic revival in our own
century, and a return to mosaic principles, that stained glass
awoke to new life.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<br />
THE NEEDLE POINT IN GLASS PAINTING.</h3>

<p>Allusion has been made to the glass painter&#8217;s use of the point
for scraping out lights, and especially diapers upon glass coated
with pigment. These are often quite lace-like in their delicacy.
That would be a poor compliment if it meant that the glass
painter had had no more wit than to imitate the effects
produced in a material absolutely unlike glass. But it is not
merely for want of a better word that the term lace-like is
used. It is strictly appropriate, and for a very good reason.
It was explained how from the first the glass painter would
use the stick end of his brush to scrape out sharp lights in
his painting, or even diaper patterns out of a tint. The latest
glass painters made more and more use of the point, and of
a finer point than the brush end, until, in Swiss work, they
adopted the pen and the needle itself. It is not surprising,
then, that point-work should resemble point-work, though the
one be in thread and the other on glass. The strange thing
would have been if it were not so. Thus it comes about that
much of the Swiss diaper work is most aptly described as
lace-like in effect.</p>

<p>The field of a small shield is frequently diapered with a
pattern so fine that it could only have been produced with a
fine point. Some of the diapers <a href="#Fig_49">opposite</a> may be identified
as portions of heraldic shields. On a shield it may be taken
to represent the engraving of the metal surface of the thing
itself; and, indeed, here again is a significant resemblance
between two technical processes.</p>

<p>To scratch with a needle or with a graver is much the same
thing; and thus many a Swiss diaper suggests damascening, and
might just as well have been executed in bright lines of gold
or silver filigree, beaten into lines graven in steel or iron, as

<p>But the use of the point was by no means reserved for
ornamental detail. It became the main resource of the painter,
and so much so, that this technique, or this development
of technique, is the most striking characteristic of Swiss glass
painting&mdash;if that should be called painting which has really
more affinity with etching.</p>

<p>For the laying on of the paint in the form of solid colour, or
of matted tint, or of skilfully floated wash, is only the groundwork
of the Swiss glass painter&#8217;s method. It scarcely needs
to be explained how admirably the point adapted itself to the
representation of hair, fur, feathers, and the like. The familiar
bears, for example, the device of the city of Berne, which occur
very frequently in Swiss heraldic work, are rendered at Lucerne
in the most marvellously skilful manner. First a juicy wash of
colour is floated all over the body of the beast, more or less
translucent, but judiciously varied so as to give <i>√† peu pr√®s</i> the
modelling of the creature. Then with a fine point the lines
of the fur are scraped out, always with an eye to the further
development of the modelling. Finally, the sharp lights are
softened, where necessary, with delicate tint, and a few fine
hair-lines are put in with a brush in dark brown.</p>

<p>By no conceivable method of execution could certain textures
be better rendered than this. A similar process is adopted in
rendering the damascened surface of slightly rounded shields;
but in that case the modelling of the ground is first obtained
by means of matt, not wash.</p>

<p>Black as a local colour, whether by way of heraldic tincture
or to represent velvet in costume, was very generally used; but
in such small quantities always as entirely to justify its use.
The practice, that is to say, referred to on <a href="#Page_57">page 57</a>, with reference
to the German work at Shrewsbury, was carried further. This
was quite a different thing from what occurs, for example, in a
late window at Montmorency, where four brown Benedictine
monks are frocked in muddy paint: that is a fault of judgment
no skill in execution could make good. In the case of black
used by way of local colour the drawing lines were of course
scraped out in clear glass, and toned, if need were, with tint.
The hair, cap, and feathers of the figure <a href="#Fig_50">opposite</a> illustrate the
processes of execution above described; the chain armour about
the man&#8217;s neck is also very deftly suggested.</p>

<p>The use of the point went further than rendering the texture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
of hair, and so on. It was used for the rendering of all texture
and the completion of modelling everywhere. The Swiss glass
painter did very much what is done in large when one draws
on brown or grey paper in white and black; only instead of
black chalk he used brown paint, and instead of putting on
white chalk he scraped away a half tint with which he had
begun by coating the glass; and of course he worked in small.</p>

<p>One knows by experience how much more telling the white
crayon is than the black, how much more modelling you seem
to get with very little drawing; and so it is in glass; and so it
was that the glass painter depended so much more upon taking
out lights than upon putting in darks. The difference between
the Swiss manner and the process already described in reference
to Renaissance church glass was mainly that, working upon
so much smaller a scale, the artist depended so much more
upon the point. His work is, in fact, a kind of etching. It is
the exact reverse of drawing in pen and ink, where the
draughtsman works line by line up to his darkest shadow.
Here he works line by line to clearest light, precisely as the
etcher draws his negative upon copper, only on glass it is the
positive picture which is produced. So far as manipulation
is concerned the two processes are identical. It is indeed quite
within the bounds of possibility that the method of the glass
painter (and not that of the damascener, as generally supposed)
may first have put the etcher upon the track of his technique.</p>

<p>The method of workmanship employed by the painter is shown
pretty clearly on <a href="#Fig_50">page 90</a>. In spite of a certain granular
surface given by the stone employed by the lithographer in
reproducing the design, it is quite clearly seen how the man&#8217;s
armour and the texture of the silk in his sleeves is all obtained
by the point. The trace of the needle is not clearly shown in
the flesh, except in the hand upon his hip; but on <a href="#Fig_51">page 93</a> it
is everywhere apparent&mdash;in the shading of the architecture, at
the top of the page, in the damascening of the tops of shields
below, in the drawing of the pastoral staff, in the modelling
of the mitre and the representation of the jewels upon it, no
less than in the rendering of the texture of the silk.</p>

<p>This ultra-delicacy of workmanship was naturally carried to
its furthest extent upon white glass or upon white and stain,
but the same method was employed with pot-metal colour; and,
during the early part of the sixteenth century at least, pot-metal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
colour was used when it conveniently could be, and the leading
was sometimes cleverly schemed, though the glass employed
was often crude in colour. Eventually, in Switzerland as
everywhere, enamel colour succeeded pot-metal, by which, of
course, it would have been impossible correctly to render the
tinctures of elaborately quartered shields on the minute scale
to which they were customarily drawn. At Lucerne, for
example, there are some small circular medallions with coats
of arms not much bigger than occur on the back of an old-fashioned
watchcase. Needless to say that there the drawing
is done entirely with a point. This kind of thing is, of course,
glass painting in miniature; it is not meant to say that it
is effective; but it is none the less marvellously done. It was
at its best, roughly speaking, from 1530 to a little later than
1600. Some of the very best that was ever done, now at the
Rath-haus at Lucerne, bears date from 1606-1609; there is
some also at the Hof-kirche there; but that is out of the reach
of ordinary sight, and this is placed where it can conveniently
be studied. The point-work, it should be understood, is still
always scraped out of brown, or it may be black. The enamel
that may be used with it is floated on independently of this; and
as time went on enamel was of course very largely used, especially
in the seventeenth century. To the credit of the Swiss it should
be said that, alone among later glass painters, they were at once
conscientious and expert in the chemistry of their art, and used
enamel which has been proof against time. They knew their
trade, and practised it devotedly. Possibly it was the small
scale upon which they worked which enabled them to fuse the
enamel thoroughly with the glass. It is due to them also to
say that, though their style may have been finikin, there was
nothing feeble about their workmanship; that was masterly.
And they remain the masters of delicate manipulation and
finish in glass painting.</p>

<p>Although the needle point was used to most effective purpose
in Swiss glass it did not of course entirely supersede other
methods. At the Germanic Museum at Nuremberg (where
there is a fair amount of good work, 1502-1672) there is some
matted tint which is shaded and then lined in brown, much after
the manner of one of D√ºrer&#8217;s woodcuts. It has very much
the appearance of a pen drawing shaded, as many of the old
masters&#8217; drawings were, in brown wash.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 317px;">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
A fair amount of simple figure work in white and stain
continued to be done, in which outline went for a good deal, and
matted shadow was only here and there helped out with the
point. In landscape backgrounds shade tint was sometimes
broadly and directly floated on. But as often as not shading
was executed to a great extent with the needle, whilst local
colour was painted with enamel. Even in association with
admirable heraldry and figure work, one finds distant figure
groups and landscapes painted in this way. They look more
like coloured magic-lantern slides than painted window glass.</p>

<p>Sometimes subtlety of workmanship was carried rather
beyond the bounds of discretion, as when at Nuremberg
(1530) faces were painted in tint against clear glass, without
outline, the mere shading, delicate as it is, being depended
upon to relieve them from the ground. It must be confessed
that, near to the eye, it does that; but the practice does not
recommend itself.</p>

<p>It is remarkable how very faint a matt of colour on the
surface of transparent glass gives a sort of opacity to it which
distinguishes it from the clear ground. Sometimes white enamel
is used, sometimes perhaps a mere coat of flux: it is difficult
to say what it is, but there is often on the lightest portions
of the painted glass no more than the veriest film, to show that
it has been painted.</p>

<p>It is obvious that glass of the most delicate character
described must be the work of the designer; and it seems
clear, from numerous drawings extant, which are evidently the
cartoons for Swiss window panes, that the draughtsman contemplated
carrying out his design himself. At all events, he
frequently left so much out of these drawings, that, if he trusted
to the painting of another, no little of the credit of the draughtsmanship
was due to that other, and he was at least part designer
of the window. In glass where painting is carried to a high
state of perfection it goes without saying that the painter must
be an artist second only to the designer. Invention and technical
power do not always go together. But if the designer
can paint his own glass, and will, so much the better. It is
more than probable that the best glass is the autograph work
of the designer.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.<br />
<br />
THE RESOURCES OF THE GLASS PAINTER&mdash;A RECAPITULATION.</h3>

<p>Having followed the course of technique thus far, it may be
as well to survey the situation and see where we now stand.
Suppose an artist altogether without experience in glass had
occasion to design a window. The first thing he would want
to know would be the means at his command at this present
moment, and what dependence he could place upon them.
That is what it is intended briefly to set forth in this chapter,
quite without reference to date or style or anything but the
capacities of the material. The question is, what can be done
with it? Not until a man knows that is he in a position to
make up his mind as to what he will do.</p>

<p>If he ask, as artists will, why cannot he do just what he likes,
and as he likes, the answer is: because glass was not made for
him, and will only do what he wants on condition of his
demands upon it being reasonable. He might find it pleasanter
if the world revolved round him; but it does not. If he would
make a window he must go the way of glass; and the way of
glass is this:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the first place, it is mosaic. It may be a mosaic of white
glass or of the pearly tints which go to make what is termed
grisaille, in which case the leads which bind the glass together
form the pattern, or, at all events, a feature in it. Or it may
be of coloured glass, or of white and colour, in which case the
glass forms the pattern, and the lead joints are more or less lost
in the outline of the design.</p>

<p>If the pattern is in white upon a deep-coloured ground the lead joints
crossing the pattern and not forming part of it are, as it were, eaten
up by the spreading rays of white light, and, supposing them to be
judiciously contrived, do not count for much. On the other hand, the
lead joints crossing the coloured ground are lost in its depth.
Advantage is taken of this to break up the ground more than would be
necessary for convenience of glazing, or of strength when glazed, and so
to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> that variety of pot-metal upon which so much of the
beauty of glass colour depends.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 288px;">
<a id="Fig_52" name="Fig_52"></a>
<img src="images/fig_52.png" width="288" height="300" alt="Plain Glazing" title="Plain Glazing" />
<span class="caption">52. <span class="smcap">Plain Glazing, Early French.</span></span>
</div>

<p>To give satisfactory colour the best of pot-metal glass is essential.
Structural conditions which a man is bound to take into account in his
design are&mdash;that the shapes he draws must be such as can readily be
cut by the glazier; that his lead joints must be so schemed as, where
not lost in the glass, to form part of the design, strengthening, for
example, the outlines; that his plan must at intervals include provision
for substantial iron bars which shall not interfere with the drawing.</p>

<p>He must understand that each separate colour in his composition is
represented by a separate piece of glass, cut out of a sheet of the
required colour. There may, and should, however, be variety in it. A
sheet of glass varies in depth of tone according to its thickness, which
in the best glass is never even; moreover, it may be streaked or
otherwise accidentally varied; and so considerable play of tint may be
got in a well-selected piece of pot-metal. Should a tint be required
which the palette of the glazier does not supply it may sometimes be
obtained by leading up two thicknesses of glass together. This expedient
is called &#8220;plating.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 77px;">
<a id="Fig_53" name="Fig_53"></a>
<img src="images/fig_53.png" width="77" height="250" alt="Mosaic Glass" title="Mosaic Glass" />
<span class="caption">53. <span class="smcap">Mosaic Glass, Assisi.</span></span>
</div>

<p>There are two very workmanlike ways in which white and colour may be
obtained in one piece of glass. If the glass is not coloured throughout
its thickness, but only a part of the way through, the coloured part may
be eaten away in places by acid (it used formerly to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
tediously abraded); and so a pattern of white may be traced upon a
ground of blue, for example, or, as is more common, ruby.</p>

<p>A piece of white or pale coloured glass may further be <i>stained</i>,
but only, so far, of one colour, yellow. The window <a href="#Fig_54">opposite</a>
is all in white and golden-yellow. This result is produced by
the action of silver upon it, which, at a sufficient temperature,
develops a tint varying from lemon to orange of beautiful
quality, and as imperishable as the glass; but one cannot be
quite certain always as to the precise shade it will take in the
fire. On blue it gives green, and so on.</p>

<p>By the combination of these two processes three tints may be
obtained, or even four upon the same piece of glass&mdash;say white,
green, and yellow all upon a blue ground.</p>

<p>There is a third method of avoiding lead glazing. If little
jewels of coloured glass be cut out of various sheets and placed
upon white glass they become fused at a sufficient heat in the
kiln, and adhere more or less firmly to the glass on which they
are laid; but this process of &#8220;annealing&#8221; is not very safe. Still
less to be depended upon is the fourth process of &#8220;enamelling.&#8221;
In that case the coloured glass is applied in the form of a paint
upon a sheet of white. Fusing at a comparatively low temperature,
it rarely gets quite firmly fixed. Nor has it the depth of
pot-metal colour. The three processes of staining, annealing,
and enamelling, entail, it will be seen, the burning of the glass.
Literally this is the limit of what can be done in stained glass.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">54. WINDOW IN WHITE AND STAIN, WARWICK CASTLE.</span></p>

<p>The term stained glass, however, is generally used to include
painting, which from the first has been associated with it.
This painting (not to be confounded with the above mentioned
enamelling) is a second process, which the glass undergoes after
it is cut and before it is fired. It is not in the least what a
painter understands by painting. It is, in the first place,
a means of giving in solid brown pigment, which effectually
stops out the light, detail smaller than mere glazing would
permit, such as the features of a face or the veining of a leaf: it
gives the foils of the foliage, and marks the individual berries in
the border overleaf. In the next it is used partially to obscure
the glass, so as to give shading. The pigment is not used as
colour, but for drawing and shading only. Local colour is
represented by the pieces of pot-metal glass employed; the
painting fulfils precisely the part of the engraving in a print
coloured by hand. The various methods of painting are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a><br /><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
explained on <a href="#Page_45">pages 45</a>, <a href="#Page_64">64</a>, <a href="#Page_89">89</a>.  In some respects they have
more affinity with line drawing, mezzotint, and
etching than with oil or water-colour painting.</p>

<p>It is extremely difficult to get delicacy of
modelling or high finish at one painting&mdash;to all
but a consummate glass painter impossible.
Many a time the work has to be painted several
times over, each painting being separately burnt
in, always at some risk. Painting that is not
sufficiently fired peels off in time. If it is fired
too much it may be burnt quite away.</p>

<p>The effect of paint in the form of shading is
naturally to obscure the glass. Up to a certain
point there is not much harm in that; it counts
for nothing as compared with the facilities of
expression it affords. But that point is soon reached. Then
it becomes a question of the relative value of, on the one
hand, purity and translucency of glass colour, and, on the
other, of pictorial qualities. The problem is to get the utmost
of modelling or expression with the minimum of obscuration.
Much depends upon the method of painting adopted. So
long as the light is allowed to get through it, one may indulge
in a fair amount of shading, but a deep even tint, leaving none
of the glass clear, is inevitably heavy. The more one can
represent shadows by deeper tinted glass the more brilliant
the result will be.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 117px;">

</div>

<p>This painting, although, strictly speaking, in brown enamel, is
not, as was said, what is usually meant by enamel painting: that
is described on <a href="#Page_77">page 77</a>. A window may be painted altogether
in enamel; and, when the mosaic method went out, designs
were painted in enamel upon panes of plain white glass; but,
for the most part, since the pieces had to be connected by lead,
it was found convenient to use pot-metal for some of the
stronger colours. In recent times, however, owing to the
introduction of large sheets of thicker glass, to improved glass
kilns, and also to more accurate knowledge of the chemistry
of enamel colours, it is possible to paint a picture-window on
one sheet of glass. That has been done with extraordinary
skill at S√®vres. You may see really marvellous results in this
kind in the Chapel of the Bourbons at Dreux. If you want
neither more nor less than a picture upon glass, and are content<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
with a picture in which the shadows are opaque and the lights
transparent, that is the way to get it. You will not get the
qualities of glass. Within the last two or three years there
seems to have been very considerable improvement in the
purity, translucency, and depth of enamel colours. How far
they are lasting remains to be proved. Anyway, brilliant as
they are, they have not by any means the intensity of pot-metal
glass, and it does not seem, humanly speaking, possible that a
film of coloured glass upon a sheet of white can ever compete in
strength and volume with colour in the body of the glass itself.</p>

<p>If, therefore, we want the qualities of deep, rich, luminous and
translucent colour, which glass better than any other medium
can give, we must resort to the use of pot-metal&mdash;that is to say,
to glazing&mdash;assisted more or less by brown paint, used, not to get
colour, but to stop it out, or to tone it down.</p>

<p>According to the more or less of your dependence upon paint
your method may be described as mosaic or pictorial.</p>

<p>Starting upon the mosaic system, you rough out your design
in coloured glass (or what stands for it upon paper), and then
consider how, by use of paint, as above mentioned, you may
get further detail, shading, harmony of tone.</p>

<p>Starting upon the pictorial system you sketch in your design,
shade it, and colour it, and then bethink you how you can get
the glass to take those lines.</p>

<p>In either case you have, of course, from the first, a very distinct
idea as to the assistance you will get from the supplementary
process; but it makes all the difference whether you
think first of the glass or of the painting. Upon that will depend
the character of your window. If you want all that glass can
give in the way of colour, begin with the mosaic. If you want
pictorial effect, think first of your painting. If you want to get
both, balance the two considerations equally in your mind from
the first. Only, to do that, you must be a master of your trade.</p>

<p>A first consideration in the design of a window are the bars
which are to support it. The skilled designer begins by setting
these out upon his paper, nearer or closer together, according
to the width of the opening, from nine to eighteen inches
asunder. In a wide window it may be as well to make every
second or third bar extra strong. Upright stanchions may also
be introduced. Exigencies of design may make it necessary to
alter the arrangement of bars with which you set out. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
may have occasionally to bend one of them to escape a face, or
other important feature; but, if you begin with them, this will
not often be necessary. Bars may be shaped to follow the lines
of the design. There is nothing against that, except that it is
rather costly to do; and, on the whole, it is hardly worth doing.
In big windows, such as those at King&#8217;s College, Cambridge,
raised some feet above the level of the eye, stout bars have, in
effect, only about the value of strong lead lines, whilst lead
lines disappear.</p>

<p>The points to be observed with regard to glazing are these:
Since leads must form lines, it is as well to throw them as
much as possible into outlines. In a cleverly glazed window
the design will tell even when the paint has perished. To
glaze a picture in squares, regardless of the drawing, is mere
brutality. Because by aid of the diamond glass may actually
be cut to almost any shape, it is not advisable, therefore, to
design shapes awkward to cut, but rather to design the lead
lines of a window with a view to simplicity of cutting and
strength of glazing. Pieces of glass difficult to cut are the
first to break. It is the business of the designer to anticipate
breakage by introducing a lead just where it would occur.
<i>Tours de force</i> in glazing are not worth doing. It is a mistake
to be afraid of leads. Skilfully introduced, they help the effect;
and, except in work which comes very near the eye, they are
lost in the glass.</p>

<p>The quality of pot-metal glass is all important. It should
never be mechanically flat and even. The mechanically
imperfect material made in the Middle Ages is so infinitely
superior to the perfect manufacture of our day, that we have
had deliberately to aim at the accidents of colour and surface
which followed naturally from the ruder appliances and less
accurate science of those days. There are legends about lost
secrets of glass making, to which much modern produce gives
an appearance of truth. But, as a matter of fact, though old
glass undoubtedly owes something of its charm to weathering,
better and more beautiful glass was never made than is now
produced; but it is not of the cheapest, and it wants choosing.</p>

<p>The choice of glass is a very serious matter. What are
called &#8220;spoilt&#8221; sheets are invaluable. It takes an artist to
pick the pieces. But without experience in glass the judgment
even of a colourist will often be at fault.  Some colours spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
unduly, so that the effect of the juxtaposition of any two is not
by any means the same as it would be in painting. It is only
by practical experiment that a man learns, for example, how
much red will, in conjunction with blue, run into purple, and
which shade of either colour best holds its own. Effects of
this kind have been more or less scientifically explained&mdash;by
M. Viollet le Duc for one&mdash;but, in order to profit by any such
explanation, a man must have experience also.</p>

<p>Referring to &#8220;flashed&#8221; glass, all kinds of double-glass are now
made: red and blue &#61; purple, yellow and blue &#61; green, and
so on; but there is not, except, perhaps, in work on quite a
small scale, much to be gained by this. In fact, it is not well in
work on a fairly large scale to depend too much upon etching
pattern out of coated glass. In a window breadth of effect is
of more account than minuteness of detail. Damask or other
patterns in draperies might, more often than they are, be leaded
up in pot-metal. It would compel simplicity on the part of the
designer, and the effect of the glass would be richer.</p>

<p>With the increasing variety of coloured glass now made,
plating becomes less necessary than once it was. The drawback
to the practice is that dust and dirt may insinuate themselves
between the two pieces of glass, and deaden the colour. The
safe plan is to fuse the two pieces of glass together.</p>

<p>Good glass is more than half the battle. Raw glass may be
toned down by paint, but poor glass cannot be made rich by it.
The Italian glass painters often used crude greens and purples,
and softened them with brown. They might do that with
comparative safety under an Italian sky; but the deeper tones
produced that way have not the purity and lusciousness of juicy
pot-metal, and the paint is liable to peel off and betray the
poverty of the cheap material. It is the fundamental mistake
of the painter, because by means of paint he can do so much,
to depend upon it for more than it can do. The toning of local
colour with brown paint is only a makeshift for more thoroughly
mosaic work; but it is an ever-present temptation to the
painter, and one against which he should be on his guard.</p>

<p>The actual technique of glass painting, it has been explained
already, is quite different from painting as the painter understands
it; often it is not so much painting as scraping out paint.
The artist may, nay must, choose his own technique. He will
get his effect in the way most sympathetic to him. What he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
has to remember is, that, except where he wants actually to stop out
light, he must get light into his shadows&mdash;whether by stippling the
wet colour, or by scrubbing it when dry with a hog tool, or by scraping
with a point, is his affair. For example, if he wants to lower the tint
of a piece of glass, the worst thing he could do would be to coat it
with an even film of paint. It would be better to stipple it so that in
parts more light came through. But the best way of preserving the
brilliancy of the glass would be either to paint the glass with
cross-hatched lines, or to scrape bright lines out of a coat of paint.</p>

<span class="caption">56. <span class="smcap">Scratched Diaper.</span></span>
</div>

<p>In draperies, backgrounds, and so on, this is most effectively done in
the form of a diaper, often as minute as damascening, which scarcely
counts much as pattern. Bold or delicate, a diaper is quite the most
effective means of lowering colour; even hard lines seldom appear hard
in glass, owing to the spreading of the light as it comes through; but
the inevitable hardness of lines scraped out may be mitigated by dabbing
the wet paint so as to make it uneven, or by rubbing off part of the
paint after the lines have been scraped out. Another and yet another
delicate film of paint may be passed over the painted diaper by a
skilful hand, but out of each film lights should be scraped if the full
value of the glass is to be preserved.</p>

<p>Solid pigment as local colour is a thing to indulge in only with extreme
moderation. The strong black lead lines often want lines or touches of
black strong enough to keep them in countenance (that is not
sufficiently remembered, and it is when it is forgotten that the leads
assert their harshness in white glass), and here and there, in work on a
small scale, a point of black (a velvet cap, a bag, a shoe, as shown
<a href="#Fig_57">overleaf</a>,) is very valuable as local colour; but, when the scale allows,
it is better always to get this mass in dark-toned glass, which gives
the necessary depth of colour most easily, most safely, and with most
luminous effect.</p>

<p>The thing not to do, is to paint the robes of black-draped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
figures in black, a common practice in the seventeenth century.
On the other hand, a robe of black richly embroidered with gold
and pearls may quite well be rendered, as it was in late Gothic
work, by solid paint, because the pearls being only delicately
painted, and the gold being in great part perfectly clear yellow
stain, plenty of light shines through.</p>

<p>As to the means of getting delicate painting in glass, the
utmost delicacy can be got, but it costs patient labour, and
there is risk of its going for nothing.</p>

<p>The only quite safe way of getting very delicate effects of painting is
to paint much stronger than it is meant to appear. A very fierce fire
will then reduce that to a mere ghost of what it was; possibly it will
burn it away altogether. Upon this ghost of your first painting you may
paint once again, strengthening it (and indeed exaggerating it) in all
but quite the most delicate parts. A strong fire will, as before, reduce
this without affecting the first painting. Possibly a third or even a
fourth painting may be necessary to an effect of high finish. When you
have it, it is as lasting as the glass itself.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<a id="Fig_57" name="Fig_57"></a>
<img src="images/fig_57.png" width="300" height="294" alt="S. Mary&#8217;s, Shrewsbury." title="S. Mary&#8217;s, Shrewsbury." />
<span class="caption">57. <span class="smcap">S. Mary&#8217;s, Shrewsbury.</span></span>
</div>

<p>This painstaking process, however, is found to be tedious.
A much easier plan is to add to the pigment a quantity of
borax, or other substance which will make it flow easily in the
kiln. That necessitates only a gentle fire, in which there is no
risk of burning away the work done, and enables you to do in
one or two operations what would have taken three or four.
But the gentle fire required to fix soft flux only fixes it gently.
Securely to fix the pigment, the glass should have been raised
to almost red heat, to the point, in fact, at which it just begins
to melt, and the colour actually sinks into it, and becomes one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
with it. A heat anything like that would have wiped out soft
colour altogether. Moreover, the borax flux itself is very
readily decomposed by the moisture of a climate like ours.
Accordingly the more easily executed work cannot possibly
be fast. It fades, they say. That is not the case. It simply
crumbles off, sooner or later; but eventually the atmosphere
has its way with it. That is how we see in modern windows
faces in which the features grow dim and disappear.</p>

<p>We have got to reckon with this certainty, that if we want
our painting to last we must fire it very severely. What will
not stand a fierce oven will not stand the weather.</p>

<p>In view of the labour and risk involved in very delicate
painting it becomes a question how far it is worth while.
That will depend upon the artist&#8217;s purpose. But the moral
seems to be that, for purposes of decoration generally, it would
be better not to aim at too great delicacy of effect, which is
after all not the quality most valuable, any more than it is most
readily attainable, in glass.</p>

<p>Only those who have had actual experience in glass appreciate
the value of silver stain. It gives the purest and most beautiful
quality of yellow, from lemon to orange, brilliant as gold.
There is some risk with it. One kind of glass will take it kindly,
another will reject it; you have to choose your glass with
reference to it. The fire may bring it to a deeper colour than
is wanted. It may even come out so heavy and obscure
that it has to be removed with acid, and renewed. Some all
but inevitable uncertainty as to its tint, renders this peculiar
yellow more suitable for use where absolute certainty of
tint is not essential. Nevertheless, the skilled glass painter
makes no difficulty of doubling the process, and staining a
dark yellow upon a lighter, with very beautiful results.
Occasionally a master of his craft has gone so far as literally
to paint in stain, scraping out his high lights in white, and
giving, for example, the very picture of embossed goldsmith&#8217;s
work.</p>

<p>In the diapering of draperies and the like stain is of great
service, and again in landscape upon blue. But it has not
been used for all it is worth as a means of qualifying colour
which is not precisely right, apart altogether from pattern.
Many a time where a scum of paint has been employed to
reduce a tint, a judicious blur of stain, not appreciable as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
such, would have done it more satisfactorily, without in the
least obscuring the glass.</p>

<p>Nowhere is silver stain more invaluable than in windows
of white glass or <i>grisaille</i>, the quality of which is not
sufficiently appreciated. The mother-of-pearl-like tints of what
is called white glass lend themselves, in experienced hands,
to effects of opalescent colour as beautiful in their way as the
deeper pot-metal tones.</p>

<p>There is no great difficulty in combining <i>grisaille</i> and colour,
provided the white be not too thin nor the colour too deep;
but the happiest combinations are where one or the other
is distinctly predominant. With very deep rich glass, such
as that used in the thirteenth century, it is most difficult to
use white in anything like a patch (for the flesh, for example,
in figure work). Unless very heavily painted it asserts itself
too much, and heavy paint destroys its quality. Practically
the only thing to do is to use glass of really rather strong tint,
which in its place has very much the value of white. The
&#8220;whites&#8221; in Early windows are a long way from purity. They
are greenish, bone colour, horny; but they have much more
the effect of white than has, for example, pure white glass
reduced by paint to a granular tint of umber.</p>

<p>Flesh tints present a difficulty always, unless you are content
to accept a quite conventional rendering of it. In connection
with strong colour you may use flesh-tinted glass; but that
is just the one tint which it is most difficult to get in glass.
It is usually too pink. Painting on white glass in brown
produces the most invariably happy results, and in windows
into which white largely enters that is quite the best expedient
to adopt. In practice it proves ordinarily a mistake to adopt
a warmer brown for flesh tint, or to paint it in brown and red,
as was done in the sixteenth century and after that. It looks
always unpleasantly hot. When flesh wants relieving against
white it is better to use a colder white glass for the background.
The only condition under which warm-tinted flesh is quite
acceptable is when it is in the midst of strong red and yellow.
The use of red enamel for flesh seems to be a weak, unnecessary,
and unavailing concession to the pictorial. It does not give
the effect of actual flesh, and it does not help the effect of the
window. Since you cannot get actual flesh tones it is as well
to accept the convention of white flesh, which gives breadth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
and dignity to the glass. There is a sort of frivolity about
enamelled flesh-pink. It is, in a way, pretty, but out of
key with the monumental character of a window. Glass
lends itself best to strong, large work. The quality of pot-metal
gives the colour chord. The leads give the key to the
scale of design&mdash;the pitch, as it were, of the artist&#8217;s voice.
That these are strong (it is seldom worth while resorting to
extra thin leads) does not argue that design must be coarse.
You have to balance them with strong work, with patches,
perhaps, as well as strong lines, of dark paint, to carry off any
appearance of brutality in them. This done, much delicate
detail may be introduced. A strong design need not shout
any more than a speaker need, who knows how to manage his
voice. That is the condition: you must know your instrument,
and have it under control.</p>

<p>Experience seems to show that a certain formality of design
befits stained glass. Formality of colour arrangement soon
becomes tedious; but it is seldom, if ever, that the design
of glass strikes one as unduly formal.</p>

<p>Mosaic glass is designed, it was said above, with a view
to glazing. The skilled artist designs, so to speak, in leads;
but they are not the design; in fact, they count only as
contours, and, except in mere glazing, they should not be
expected to give lines. It is a common fault to make leads
take a part in the design which they will not play in the
glass.</p>

<p>In drawing, strong, firm, even angular lines are valuable,
if not imperative. The radiating light softens them. Drawing
which is already suave is likely to be too soft in the glass,
to want accent. Only experience will tell you how much you
must attenuate fingers and the like in your drawing in order
that the light shall fill them out, and give them just their normal
plumpness. The beginner never allows enough for the spreading
of light.</p>

<p>Glass painters who know what they are about use plenty of
solid painting out; but it takes experience to do it cunningly.
An artist whose <i>m√©tier</i> is really glass is not careful of the
appearance of his drawings. Cartoons are nothing but plans
of glass, not intrinsically of any account. Really good glass is
better than the drawings for it&mdash;necessary as good sketches may
be to please the ignorant patron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
New departures in technique will suggest themselves to every
inventive mind. They may even be forced upon a man&mdash;as,
by his own confession, they were forced upon Mr. Lafarge&mdash;by
the inadequacy of the materials within his reach, or the
incompetence of the workmen on whom he has to depend.
Mr. Lafarge&#8217;s glass is sometimes very beautiful in colour, and is
strikingly unlike modern European manufacture; but it is not so
absolutely original in method as Americans appear to think.
He seems to have discovered for himself some practices which
he might have learnt from old or even modern work, and to
have carried others a step further than was done before. The
basis of his first idea, he explains, was in a large way to recall
the inlay of precious stones that are set in jade by Eastern
artists. That was practically the notion of the earliest Byzantine
workers in glass. His use of other materials than glass in
windows he might have learnt from China, Java, or Japan,
where they use oyster, tortoise, and crocodile shell; or from
ancient Rome, where mica, shells, and alabaster were employed.
There is nothing very new in blended, streaked, or even
wrinkled glass, except that moderns do by deliberate intention
what the medi√¶val glass-maker could not help but do, and
carry it farther than they. In chipping flakes or chunks out of
a solid lump of glass, Mr. Lafarge certainly struck out an idea
which had probably occurred to no one since, in prehistoric ages,
man shaped his arrow heads and so on out of flint. He has
produced very beautiful and jewel-like effects by means of this
chipping, though the material lends itself best to a more
barbaric style of design than the artist has usually been content
to adopt. He has appreciated, no one better, the quality of
glass, but not the fact that so characteristic a material as he
adopts must rule the design. The attempt to get pictorial,
atmospheric, or other naturalistic effects by means of it, soon
brings you to its limitations. At the rendering of flesh it comes
to a full stop.</p>

<p>The experiment has been tried by Mr. Lafarge of a minute
mosaic of little pieces of glass between two sheets of white,
all fused into one; but it appears to be too costly, if not too
uncertain an expedient, to be really practical as a means of
rendering the human face, more especially if you want to get
expression, which is there of more importance than natural
colour. Another new departure, the device of blowing glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
into shapes, so as to get modelling in them, results so far
in rather dumb and indeterminate form.</p>

<p>It is quite possible to melt together a mosaic of glass without
the use of lead. That practice may yet come into use in window
panes, but they will be as costly as they are fragile. In larger
work there is no real artistic reason why lead or its equivalent
should be avoided. How much old glass would have remained
to us if it had been executed in huge sheets? Here and there
perhaps a broken scrap in a museum.</p>

<p>It is not meant to suggest that we should do in the nineteenth
century only what was done in times gone by. Our means are
ampler now, our wants are more. We can follow tradition
only so far as it suits our wants; and, in carrying it further,
we are sure to arrive at something so different that it may be
called a new thing. If old methods do not meet new conditions
we must invent others. The problem of our day is how
to reconcile manufacture with anything like art; or failing
that, whether there is a livelihood for the independent artist-craftsman?</p>

<p>Whoever it may be that is to make our stained glass windows
in the future, he will have to make them fit the times. He may
discover new materials. Meanwhile it is of no use quarrelling
with those he has. He must know them and humour them.
Bars have to be accepted as needful supports, leads to be
acknowledged as convenient joints; glass must be allowed its
translucency, and painting kept to what it can best do. A
window should own itself a window.</p>

<p>And what is the aim and use of a stained glass window? To
&#8220;exclude the light,&#8221; said the poet, sarcastically. Yes, to subdue
its garishness, soften its glare, tinge it with colour, animate it
with form perhaps.</p>

<p>The man who means to do good work in windows will devote
as serious study to old glass as a painter to the old masters.
He will not rest satisfied without knowing what has been done,
how it was done, and why it was done so; but he will not blind
himself to new possibilities because they have never yet been
tried. The pity is that often the antiquary is so bigoted, the
glass painter so mechanical, the artist so ignorant of glass.
The three men want fusing into one. The ideal craftsman
is a man familiar with good work, old and new, a master of
his trade, and an artist all the while; a man too appreciative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
of the best to be easily satisfied with his own work, too
confident in himself to accept what has been done as final;
a man experimenting always, but basing his experiments upon
experience, and proving his reverence for the great men who
light the way for him by daring, as a man has always dared,
to be himself.</p>

<h2>BOOK II.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<br />
THE DESIGN OF EARLY GLASS.</h3>

<p>Design in glass developed itself on lines almost parallel to the
progress of technique. Each, of course, affected the other&mdash;how
and why it is now proposed to show.</p>

<p>It is not intended at present to say more than is absolutely
necessary about &#8220;Style,&#8221; in the historic sense&mdash;that is reserved
for a chapter by itself&mdash;but, as it is convenient to refer to a
period of design by its name, it will be as well at this stage
briefly to enumerate the historic &#8220;Periods.&#8221;</p>

<p>Glass follows, inevitably, the style of architecture of the
period. Accordingly it is divided broadly into Gothic and
Renaissance. Gothic, in its turn, is divided by Rickman (who
first attempted to discriminate between the styles of architecture
in England) into three periods. Winston, who did
for English glass what Rickman did for English architecture,
adopts his classification as follows:&mdash;Early Gothic&mdash;to about
1280. Decorated Gothic&mdash;to about 1380. Perpendicular
Gothic&mdash;to about 1530.</p>

<p>Renaissance art has been classified in Italy according to
the century, and in France has been named after the reigning
sovereign&mdash;Fran√ßois Premier, Henri Deux, and so on. In England
also we make use of the terms Tudor, Elizabethan, Jacobean,
and the like. No one, however, has attempted to draw subtle
distinctions between the periods of Renaissance glass, for the
obvious reason that the best of it was done within a comparatively
short period, and the rest is not of much account. It is
enough, therefore, to mark off two divisions of Renaissance glass.
The first (which overlaps the latest Gothic) may be called
Sixteenth Century, or by the Italian name Cinque-Cento, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
simply Renaissance; whilst the second, which includes seventeenth
century and later work, is sufficiently described as
Late glass.</p>

<p>The development of style in other countries was not quite
parallel with its march on this side of the water. The French
were always in advance of us, whether in Gothic or Renaissance;
the Germans lagged behind, at all events in Gothic; but the
pace is equal enough for us to group windows generally into
three Gothic and two Renaissance periods&mdash;Early, Middle, and
Late Gothic; Early and Late Renaissance. If we do that it
will concern us less, that Early German work is more
Romanesque than Gothic, that Late French work is not
Perpendicular but Flamboyant, and so on.</p>

<p>The accepted classification is determined mainly by the
character of the architectural or ornamental detail of the
design. Such architectural or other detail&mdash;that of costume,
for example&mdash;is of the very greatest use as a clue to the date
of glass. That is a question of arch√¶ology; but it is not
so much the dates that artists or workmen have to do with as
with the course of craftsmanship, the development of art. It
is convenient for us to mark here and there a point where
art or workmanship has clearly reached a new stage; it gives
us breathing time, a starting-point on some fresh voyage of
discovery; but such points need be few. The less we bother
ourselves by arbitrary subdivisions of style the better; and
Winston himself allows that his divisions are arbitrary.</p>

<span class="caption">58. <span class="smcap">Poitiers.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The student need not very seriously concern himself about
dates or names. People are much too anxious to get a term
for everything, and when they can use the term glibly they
fancy they know all about the thing. It is no doubt easier to
commit to memory a few names and a few dates than to know
anything about a craft; but the one accomplishment will not
do in place of the other. A very little real knowledge of art or
practical workmanship will lead you to suspect, what is the
truth, that there is a good deal of fee-fi-fo-fum about the jargon
of styles. It is handy to talk of old work as belonging to
this or that broadly marked historic period; and it is well worth
the while of any one interested in the course of art to master the
characteristics of style. The student should master them as a
matter of course; but he must not take the consideration of
period for more than it is worth. Really we give far too much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
attention to these fashions of bygone days&mdash;fashions, it must be
allowed, on a more or less colossal scale, compared to ours, but
still only fashions.</p>

<p>It is proposed then to allude here only so far to the styles
as may be necessary to explain the progress of design, and
especially the design of stained glass windows.</p>

</div>

<p>In dividing Gothic into Early, Middle, and Late Gothic, corresponding
roughly with the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries, it is
not forgotten that there is an earlier Gothic of the twelfth and perhaps
eleventh centuries, more or less reminiscent of the Romanesque period
preceding it; but English glass begins, to all intents and purposes,
with the thirteenth century, and even in France there is not a very
great quantity of characteristically earlier glass. What there is
differs from thirteenth century work mainly in the Romanesque character
of the figure drawing and ornamental detail, in its deliberately simple
composition, and in the spontaneity of its design. The glazier was still
feeling his way. Any composition to be found in a Byzantine
ivory-carving, enamel, illuminated manuscript, or what not, might just
as well occur in glass. The more familiar types of early Gothic window
design had not yet settled down into orthodoxy. The lines on which the
oldest windows extant were set out are in the main those of the
thirteenth century also. They were more or less suggested by the shape
of the window opening, which, it will be seen, had always had a good
deal to say as to the direction glass design should take.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 99px;">
<a id="Fig_60" name="Fig_60"></a>
<img src="images/fig_60.png" width="99" height="250" alt="Poitiers, North Transept." title="Poitiers, North Transept." />
<span class="caption">60. <span class="smcap">Poitiers, North Transept.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The window openings in Romanesque or Norman-French
churches were single lights, round or pointed arched, rather
broad in proportion to their width. Stained glass, it has been
explained, has to be held in its place by copper wires, soldered
to the leadwork, and attached to iron bars let into the masonry
for that purpose. In the case of a very narrow lancet, such bars
would naturally be placed at convenient intervals across the
opening. But for the most part windows were the reverse of
narrow, and the horizontal bars had to be supplemented by
vertical stanchions, so that the window space was divided into
rectangular divisions. As a matter of construction the glass was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
made in panels, corresponding to these, and attached to them. It is not
surprising, therefore, that these divisions should often have been
accepted as part of the design, or that the design of the glass should
to some extent have followed them. On <a href="#Fig_58">page 113</a> is the skeleton of the
upper part of a twelfth century window. The strong black lines in the
diagram show the bars, the finer ones indicate the main divisions of the
design of the glass. It will be seen that the four strips into which the
upright bars divide the window are not equal, but that the outer
divisions are narrower than the inner, so as to accommodate themselves
to the width of the border. Naturally that was determined always by the
proportion of the window; such borders measured often one-sixth part, or
more, of the entire width. The way in which the central circular shape
in the glass breaks across in front of the border is an instance of the
spontaneity and unexpectedness of design characteristic of the earliest
existing work; later one series of forms would repeat themselves without
interruption throughout the length of the window. When, as <a href="#Fig_59">above</a>, the
centre of a window is occupied by a great crucifix, or, as <a href="#Fig_60">below</a>, other
such irregularity occurs, it is safe to conclude that the glass, if not
prior to the thirteenth century, belongs to its first years. It is
characteristic of the very early date of the glass that the bars in the
diagrams given do not go out of their way to follow the outline of the
circles, vesicas, quatrefoils, and other shapes, but on occasion cut
relentlessly across them.</p>

<p>The filling out of such a skeleton as those
given would in many respects be much the
same in the eleventh, twelfth, or thirteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
century; and in each case it would be in direct pursuance of
the traditions of Early Christian design. You may see in
Byzantine ivories and enamels precisely the kind of thing
that was done in glass; and in the Romanesque Michaelis
Kirche at Hildesheim, is a painted roof, the design of
which might have been carried out, just as it is, in a giant
window.</p>

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">61 and 62. <span class="smcap">Border, Angers.</span></span></p>

<p>The main divisions of the centre part of such a window would
each contain its little &#8220;subject&#8221; or glass picture; the border
and the interstices between the pictures would be occupied with
foliated ornament; only, the earlier the work, the more pronounced
would be the Romanesque character, alike of the
ornament and the figure work. The broad borders from Angers,
<a href="#Fig_61">above</a>, and the narrower one from Le Mans (<a href="#Fig_218">page 327</a>) differ
materially from the accepted thirteenth century type (<a href="#Fig_64">page 117</a>).
Witness how in the Angers glass the stalks of the foliage frame
little panels in the border, and how in the Le Mans work the
stalks take the form of straps, patterned with painted ornament.
This elaboration of the stalks with painted zig-zag, pearlwork,
and so on, is precisely the kind of thing one sees in Byzantine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
carving and inlay. The very early spandril from Angers, <a href="#Fig_63">below</a>,
if not markedly Romanesque in character is yet not of the
distinctively Early Gothic type.</p>

<p>The shape of each medallion would be emphasised by a series of coloured
lines or fillets framing it. In quite early work the broader of these
would be broken up into blocks of alternating colour; they would be
patterned probably (which in the thirteenth century they would probably
not be), and altogether the effect of the ornament would be more
jewelled. One of these broken and patterned margins is shown in the
vesica-shaped framing to the figure on <a href="#Fig_24">page 37</a>&mdash;belonging, by the
way, to the window given in skeleton on <a href="#Fig_60">page 114</a>.</p>

<p>The difference between twelfth and thirteenth century
pictures is in the lingering of Byzantine traditions of design
in the earlier work, and in the strictly simple disposition of the
figures <i>en silhouette</i> against the background, as well as in the way
the drapery is wrapped closely round them, so that the figure
always explains itself. There is an expression and a &#8220;go&#8221;
about some of the earliest figures for which we look in vain
later in the thirteenth century. The figures of the Apostles
from the Ascension at Le Mans on <a href="#Fig_20">page 33</a> are altogether more
alive than the thirteenth century bishops, for example, on <a href="#Fig_185">page
276</a>, who seem by comparison tame and altogether respectable.
A certain exaggeration there is, no doubt, about the action
of these earliest figures, a certain brutality of rendering, as
there is also a certain barbaric quality in the ornament, and,
indeed, in the whole effect; but of its superlative richness
there is no manner of doubt. One is even led to speculate,
when one compares it with later work, whether a
certain barbaric character of design does not go to that
unrivalled brilliancy. In the absolute glory of rich colour
the very earliest glass has never been equalled. The advance
of glass painting was at the cost of this, perhaps barbaric,
quality.</p>

<p>In the earliest windows the subjects were not invariably
enclosed in medallions; sometimes the square lines of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a><br /><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>bars would be accepted as division enough; these would be
framed with lines of colour, and the design of the portion of
the window within the border would consist (as occasionally
at Chartres) of a series of square subjects, each with its
marginal lines, ranged one above the other. For the most
part, however, the design of the earliest richly coloured windows
extant took the shape of little pictures in panels or
medallions. Another favourite scheme was to delineate the
Tree of Jesse. The upper portion of such a window is given
on <a href="#Fig_64">page 117</a>; but further consideration of Jesse windows is
reserved for a separate chapter.</p>

</div>

<p>From the earliest period, no doubt, clerestory or other lights were
often occupied each with a separate figure standing upright; but such of
these as may remain in their places are not readily distinguishable from
thirteenth century work; and the undoubtedly earlier figures&mdash;such,
for example, as those in S. Remi at Reims&mdash;have been re-set in
framework more or less old, but so as not to tell us anything very
authentic about the setting out of the original windows. Again at
Augsburg, where the figures in the clerestory are said to be the oldest
in Germany (to belong, in fact, to about the year 1000), the windows are
bordered with modern glazing in white. At Reims we have very rudely
drawn figures in rich colour against a deep background, standing with
splayed feet upon little rounds or half rings of colour, representing
the earth, their names inscribed in bold lettering, which forms a band
of yellow behind their heads. At Augsburg the figures, equally rude in
drawing, equally splay-footed, are in white and colour upon a white
ground. They stand upon little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> hemispheres of Byzantine
ornament, and their names are writ large in black letters upon the white
glass around their heads. Presumably they were framed in a border of
pattern work similar to that surrounding the medallion windows. The
ornamental work in the windows at S. Remi may not always have formed
part of the same window with the figure work&mdash;it does not go very
happily with it now&mdash;but it is probably of about the same date; and
it illustrates, together with some similar work at S. Denis, near Paris
(so &#8220;thoroughly restored&#8221; as to have lost its historic value), a kind of
pattern work peculiar to the earliest glass.</p>

<p>As a rule, early glass divides itself naturally into two classes:
work in rich colour, which is what we have hitherto been discussing,
and work in &#8220;grisaille,&#8221; as it is called; that is to say, in
which the glass is chiefly white, or whitish, relieved only here and
there by a line or a jewel of colour.</p>

<p>Occasionally, as at Auxerre, Reims, and Poitiers, rich figure
work is found set in grisaille or framed by it; and in some
fragments from Ch√¢lons, now at the <i>Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs</i> at
Paris, coloured figures are found on a white ground.</p>

<p>You find also in France rich colour-work surrounded by
white glass&mdash;the work of a period when the powers that were
became possessed of the idea that they must lighten the interior
of their churches, and accordingly removed so much of the
coloured glass as seemed good to their ignorance, and replaced
it with plain glazing. But, as a rule, and apart from the
tinkering of the latter-day ecclesiastic, rich colour and grisaille
were kept apart in early medi√¶val churches; that is to say,
a coloured window has not enough white in it perceptibly to
affect the depth and richness of its colour, nor a grisaille
window enough colour to disturb the general impression of
white light. At Reims and S. Denis, however, you find
ornament in which white and colour are so evenly balanced
that they belong to neither category. The amount of colour
introduced into grisaille was never at any time a fixed quantity;
one has to allow something for the predilection of the artist;
but here the amount of colour makes itself so distinctly felt
that the term grisaille no longer serves to express it.</p>

<p>The design of these patterns was of a rather mechanical type
(<a href="#Fig_22">pages 35</a>, <a href="#Fig_65">118</a>, <a href="#Fig_66">120</a>) and not in any case very interesting; but it
would have been difficult under any circumstances to produce a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
very satisfactory effect by so equally balancing white and colour. The
designer falls between two stools. The well-known gryphon medallions at
S. Denis seem at first to promise something rather amusing in design,
but there is no variety in them:&mdash;and no wonder! the greater number
of them prove to be new, and they have all been rearranged by Viollet le
Duc. That is as much as to say, some of the gryphons are of Abbot
Suger&#8217;s time, but the design of the window is Viollet le Duc&#8217;s. White
and colour are again too evenly mixed in the heavy-looking English glass
at Lincoln shown on <a href="#Fig_67">page 121</a>, but that is of the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>It need hardly be said that the earlier the work, the simpler was the
character of the painting, the more deliberately was pigment reserved
for painting out the light, the more strictly was the shading in lines.
But the painted detail was often small; glass was used in small pieces;
subjects themselves were ordinarily small in scale. The largeness of
effect was due first to the actual simplicity of the main lines of the
design, and then to breadth of colour, a breadth of colour all the more
remarkable seeing the small pieces of glass of which the broad surfaces
were of necessity made up.</p>

<p>Of course, too, the earlier the work the more the design was
influenced by the technique of glazing, the more clearly it can
be seen how the glazier designed (as was explained on <a href="#Page_44">page 44</a>)
in lead lines, and only made use of paint to fill them out.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>In twelfth century glass the white was greenish and rather horny in
texture; ruby was sometimes streaky, and often tawny or inclined to
orange; blue varied from deep indigo to pale grey, occasionally it was
of the colour of turquoise; yellow, dark or pale, was usually brassy;
green ranged from bluish to pale apple, and from dull to emerald. These
colours, with a rich brownish-purple, the lighter shades of which served
always as flesh tint, made up the glazier&#8217;s palette. Happily there was
considerable inequality of colour in the material. It deepened, for
example, towards the selvage of the sheet where it was thickest; it had
streaks and bubbles in it; no two batches ever came out of the pot quite
alike; and altogether the rudely made pot-metal was chemically most
imperfect and artistically all that glass should be.</p>

<span class="caption">67. <span class="smcap">Lincoln.</span></span>
</div>

<p>It would be rash in the extreme to formulate any theory as to early
schemes of colour; probably the glazier&#8217;s main thought was to get
somehow a deep, rich, solemn effect of colour. He secured this very
often by not confusing his tints, and by allowing a single colour so to
predominate that the window impressed you at once as bluish or greenish
or reddish in tone. He was on the whole happiest when he kept his colour
cool; but he produced also red windows which are never to be forgotten.</p>

<p>In the cathedral at Poitiers, where many of the beautiful
medallion windows belong to the very early part of the thirteenth
century, the scheme is usually to adopt a blue background,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
alike for the medallions and for the spaces between, relying
upon a broad band of ruby, edged with white pearling, to mark
the medallion shapes, which it effectively does; but these are
not the most beautiful windows in the church. One recognises
their date rather by the individuality and spontaneity of
the design than by any distinctly Romanesque character in
the detail. It should be mentioned, also, that at Poitiers, even
in windows which seem not so emphatically to belong to the
very beginning of the century, the early practice of using only
straight upright and cross bars is adhered to. There may be
something of local conservatism in that.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<br />
MEDALLION WINDOWS.</h3>

<p>In the thirteenth century the practice of the earlier glaziers
stiffened into something like a tradition, and design took
almost inevitably the form of (1) the Medallion window, (2) the
Single Figure window, (3) Ornamental Grisaille.</p>

<p>The full-blown thirteenth century Medallion window differed
from what had gone before in that it was more orthodox. The
designer begins as before by marking off a broad border to his
glass, defined on the inner side by an iron bar, and proceeds to
fill the space within the border with medallion shapes. But he
now adapts the medallions more regularly to the spaces between
the bars. At most two alternating shapes occur throughout the
length of the light, without break or interruption, such as
occurs in earlier work, and as a rule they keep strictly within
the lines of the border. In all the nine examples here given,
taken at random from Chartres, Bourges, Canterbury, and
elsewhere, only in one case does a medallion cut boldly across
the border in the head of the light. The slight overlapping
of the quatrefoils in one case is not really an overlapping of
the border but only of the marginal lines to it, not shown
in the diagram <a href="#Fig_68">above</a>, but clearly enough explained on <a href="#Page_132">page 132</a>,
which shows the completion of a corner of the window, less its
side border. In the window with large circular medallions
divided into four, there is no upright bar to define the border,
faintly indicated by a dotted line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 456px;">

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">69. <span class="smcap">Bars in Early Medallion Windows.</span></span></p>

<p>It will be seen from these diagrams, which illustrate at once
the main divisions of the glass and the position of the ironwork,
what a change came over the construction of windows in
the thirteenth century. The window is no longer ruled off by
upright and horizontal bars into panels into which the design
is fitted; it is the bars which are made to follow the main lines
of the design, and to emphasise the forms of the medallions.
The rare exceptions to this rule (as at Bourges, <a href="#Fig_70">overleaf</a>) may
generally be taken to betray either the beginning or the end of
the period; but at Poitiers they seem to have passed through
the early period without ever arriving at shaped bars. The
early glazier, it was said, first blocked out his design according
to his leading; here he begins with the bars. The iron framework
forms, itself, in many of these windows, a quite satisfactory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
pattern, and one which proudly asserts itself in the finished
window. The designs of the period are not of course all equally
ingenious. Sometimes, in order to strengthen a circle or quatrefoil
of great size, the glazier, instead of breaking up the shape
ornamentally as was the rule, merely supports it by cross bars;
not only that, but he accepts the awkward shapes given by them
as separate picture spaces. Of this comes one of two evils: either
he frames his little pictures with sufficient border lines to keep
them distinct, and so draws attention to the shapes, an attention
they do not deserve; or he has to accept the bars, with perhaps
a fillet of colour, as sufficient frame, which they are not, and
his pictures run together, to the bewilderment of whoever would
decipher them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">70. <span class="smcap">Spandrils of Medallion Window, Bourges.</span></span></p>

<p>It is matter for regret that the French did not accept the
full shape of even the largest medallion, and fill it with
one bold subject; over and over again one feels that the
subjects in medallion windows are not only too small to be
readable, but so small that the figures are out of scale with
the ornamental detail. The scale of the church has, of
course, to be taken into account; but the French churches
are big enough to warrant figures thrice the size of those
which ordinarily occur in medallions. In our narrower
&#8220;Early English&#8221; lancet windows the medallions naturally
came small.</p>

<p>To divide a window into eccentric divisions (halves or
quarters of circles, quatrefoils, and the like) and then to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
these awkward shapes as separate picture frames, is an archaic
method of design much in need of excuse. The more reasonable
thing to do would have been to make use of such incomplete
forms only in some secondary position, and as framework for
ornament, or at least quite subsidiary figures.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 231px;">
<a id="Fig_71" name="Fig_71"></a>
<img src="images/fig_71.png" width="231" height="300" alt="The Dream of Charlemagne" title="The Dream of Charlemagne" />
<span class="caption">71. <span class="smcap">The Dream of Charlemagne, Chartres.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Apart from shapes which are really only segments of medallions,
the only awkward medallion shapes occurring in Early
glass are those which are broader than they are high, such
as occur, for example, at Soissons. These have always the
uncomfortable appearance of having been crushed.</p>

<p>How the iron skeleton of a medallion window is filled out
with leaded glass; how the border and the medallion shapes
are strengthened by bands of colour; how the medallions
themselves are occupied with little figure subjects, and how
the interspaces are filled in with ornament, is indicated
<a href="#Fig_71">opposite</a> and on <a href="#Fig_81">pages 132</a>, <a href="#Fig_216">325</a>.</p>

<p>By way of variation upon the monotony of design, the
designer will sometimes reverse the order of things. At
Bourges, for example, you will find the centre of a light
devoted to insignificant and uninteresting ornament, whilst
the figure subjects are edged out into half quatrefoils at the
sides of the window; and, again, at Chartres and Le Mans
you may occasionally see the pictures similarly ousted from
their natural position by rather mechanical ornament. One
can sympathise with an artist&#8217;s impatience with the too,
too regular distribution of the stereotyped medallion window.
There is undoubtedly a monotony about it which the designer
is tempted to get rid of at any price; but consistency is a
heavy price to pay for the slight relief afforded by the treatment
just described.</p>

<p>This striving after strangeness results not only in very ugly picture
shapes&mdash;no one would deliberately design such a shape as that which
frames the picture of the Dream of Charlemagne (<a href="#Fig_71">overleaf</a>)&mdash;but it
produces a very uncomfortable impression of perversity. It is quite
conceivable that ornament may be better worth looking at than some
pictures; but a picture refuses to occupy the subordinate position; it
will not do as a frame to ornament. There is no occasion to illustrate
very fully the design of Early figure medallions; they are often of very
great interest, historical, legendary and human, but there is little
variation in the system of design. The picture is of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
simplest, perhaps the baldest, kind. The figures, as before stated, are
clearly defined against a strong background, usually blue or ruby; a
strip or two of coloured glass represents the earth upon which they
stand; a turret or a gable tells you that the scene is in a city; a
foliated sprig or two indicate that it is out of doors, a forest,
perhaps; a waving band of grey ornament upon the blue tells you that the
blue background stands for sky, for this is a cloud upon it. The
extremely ornamental form which conventional trees may assume is shown
in Mr. T. M. Rooke&#8217;s sketch from a medallion at Bourges, <a href="#Fig_72">opposite</a>. In
the medallions from Chartres (<a href="#Fig_216">page 325</a>) are instances of simpler and
less interesting tree forms, and in the upper part of the larger of the
two, a bank of conventional cloudwork. Explanatory inscriptions are
sometimes introduced into the background, as in the dream of Charlemagne
(<a href="#Fig_71">above</a>), or in the margin of the medallions, as in the Canterbury window
on <a href="#Fig_81">page 132</a>, fulfilling in either case an ornamental as well as an
elucidatory function.</p>

<span class="caption">72. <span class="smcap">Detail from an Early Medallion.</span></span>
</div>

<p>In the Canterbury glass it will be seen the figures are more
crowded than in the French work illustrated. This is not a
peculiarity of English glass, but a mark of period; as a rule
the clump or compact group of personages proclaims a later
date than figures isolated against the background. There is
no surer sign of very early work than the obvious display
of the figures against the background, light against dark
or dark against light. Another indication of the date of
the Canterbury figures is that their draperies do not cling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
quite so closely about them as in figures (<a href="#Fig_20">page 33</a>) in which the
Byzantine tradition is more plainly to be traced.</p>

<span class="caption">73. <span class="smcap">Canterbury.</span></span>
</div>

<p>There is no mistaking a medallion window, the type is fixed:
within a border of foliated ornament a series of circles, quatrefoils,
or other medallion shapes, for the most part occupied by
figure subjects on a rather minute scale, and between these
ornament again.</p>

</div>

<p>The border might be wider or narrower, according to the
proportion of the window, though a wide border was rather
characteristic of quite early glass. A twelfth century border
(Angers) will sometimes measure more than a quarter of the
entire width of the window. The borders from Canterbury,
Beverley, Auxerre, and Chartres (<a href="#Fig_73">overleaf</a>) are of the thirteenth.
A border of sufficient dimensions will sometimes include medallion
shapes as on <a href="#Fig_61">pages 115</a>, <a href="#Fig_216">325</a>, and even occasionally little
subject medallions at intervals, or it may be half-circles, each
containing a little figure; but such interruption of the running
border is rare. In so far as it counts against monotony it is to
the good.</p>

<p>In narrower windows, such as more frequently occur in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
country, where, as the Gothic style of architecture supplanted the
Norman, lancet lights took a characteristically tall and slender shape,
the border was reduced to less imposing proportions, as for example at
Beverley;&mdash;there was no room for a wide frame to the medallions,
nor any fear, it may be added, that these should be so large as to
require breaking up into segments, as in much French glass, or at
Canterbury: there the window openings, as was to be expected of a French
architect, are more characteristically Norman than English in
proportion. In a very narrow light in the one-time cathedral at
Carcassonne the medallions break in front of a not very wide border; but
then this, though a medallion window, belongs probably by date to the
Second Gothic period.</p>

</div>

<p>Medallions themselves may be simple or fantastic in shape.
They may be devoted each to a single picture, or subdivided
into a series of four or five; they may be closely packed, and
supported by segments of other medallions, also devoted to
figure work, or they may be separated by considerable intervals
of ornament. The character of that ornament takes two
distinct forms.</p>

<p>In the examples given (<a href="#Fig_81">pages 132</a>, <a href="#Fig_216">325</a>) it takes the form of foliated
scrollwork, very much of a piece with the ornament in the borders,
except that there is more scope for its growth. In actual detail it
varies, according to its date and whereabouts, from something very much
like Romanesque strapwork to the more or less trefoiled foliage typical
of Early Gothic ornament, whether French or English. Further examples of
the last are shown in the borders from Auxerre and Chartres (<a href="#Page_328">page 328</a>).
The one from Chartres illustrates the transition from the Romanesque; it
is intermediate between the two. The borders from S. Kunibert&#8217;s,
Cologne, are quite Romanesque in character, though they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
are of the thirteenth century; but then it has to be remembered that the
Romanesque style of architecture was flourishing on the Rhine long after
the Gothic style had developed itself in France and England. Many of the
details from Canterbury&mdash;which, by-the-bye, are almost identical
with contemporary French ornament&mdash;show a lingering influence of
the pre-Gothic period, but the scroll occupying the spandril on <a href="#Fig_81">page 132</a>
is pronouncedly of Early Gothic type. Of much the same character is the
detail from Salisbury on <a href="#Fig_64">page 117</a>, which forms no part of a medallion
window, but more likely of a tree of Jesse.</p>

<p>It was in this ornamental kind of design that the thirteenth century
glaziers were most conspicuously successful. One no longer feels here,
as one does with regard to their figure work, that they mean much better
than their powers enable them to do. And it is with scrollery of this
kind, either growing free or springing from the margin of the medallion,
that the Early English designers occupied the intervals between the
medallions in their windows. In France it became the commoner practice
to substitute for it a diaper of geometric pattern. Other expedients
were occasionally adopted. There is a window at S. Denis in which there
is foliated scrollwork on a background of geometric diaper, although
this last is so much &#8220;restored&#8221; that, for all one can tell, Viollet le
Duc may be entirely responsible for it.</p>

</div>

<p>At Soissons is a window in which the interspaces between the medallions
are filled with deep blue, broken only here and there by a spot of ruby;
at Poitiers also the ornament in spandrils is often just a quatrefoil or
so, barely foliated, if at all; at Bourges there is an instance of
spandrils (<a href="#Fig_70">page 125</a>) occupied by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> bare curling stalks and
rosette-like flowers; at Poitiers the bands which frame the medallions
have a way of interlacing, not in the simple fashion shown in the
example from Canterbury <a href="#Fig_79">below</a>, but so as to form a kind of pattern in
the spandrils in front of the geometric filling; and there are other
variations on the accustomed medallion tunes; but as a rule the ornament
consists either of the usual Early Gothic foliation, closely akin to
that in the borders, such as is shown on <a href="#Fig_73">pages 129</a>, <a href="#Fig_75">130</a>, <a href="#Fig_219">328</a>, <a href="#Fig_222">330</a>, or of
geometric pattern, such as is here given. The rarity of the mosaic
diaper in this country may be gathered from the fact that in the whole
series of Early medallion windows at Canterbury it is found only once,
its frequency in France from the fact that in the choir alone of Bourges
Cathedral it occurs in no less than twenty-two instances; again at
Chartres, out of twenty-seven great windows, not more than four have
scrollwork; at Poitiers, on the other hand, there is little geometric
diaper, but the ornament is of the simplest, and barely foliated. This
device of geometric diaper-filling was possibly inspired by the idea of
utilising the small chips of precious glass, which, with the then method
of working, must have accumulated in great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a><br /><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> quantity. In any case, it
must have been encouraged by that consideration, if not actually
suggested by it. Apart from economy, which is a condition of
craftsmanlike work, there does seem a sort of artistic logic in the use
of merely geometric design for quite subordinate filling, to act as a
foil to figure work; but there was no occasion to put the mosaic of
fragments quite so regularly, not to say mechanically, together, as was
the custom to do.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">80. <span class="smcap">French Mosaic Diapers.</span></span></p>

<p>That is shown in a rather unusual instance in a window of the Lower
Church at Assisi; there occurs there a diaper of circles with blue
interstices, where the circles, though all alike painted with a star
pattern, vary in colour in a seemingly accidental way, and are red,
yellow, green, brown, just as it took the fancy of the glazier.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">81. DETAIL OF MEDALLION WINDOW, CANTERBURY.</span></p>

<p>It follows inevitably from the small scale on which these
patterns are set out, and from the radiation of the coloured
light, that unless very great discretion is exercised the rays get
mixed, with a result which is often the reverse of pleasing.
And the worst of it was that the French glaziers particularly
affectioned a combination of red and blue most difficult to
manage. A very favourite pattern consisted of cross bands of
ruby (as <a href="#Fig_82">above</a>), enclosing squares or diamonds of blue, with
dots of white at the intersection of the ruby bands, which
persists always in running to purple.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">

<span class="caption">82. <span class="smcap">French Mosaic Diaper.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Instances of this unpleasant cast of colour are of continual
occurrence, but they are never otherwise than crude and plummy
in effect. The rather unusual combination of red and green
mosaic diaper occurs, however, pretty frequently at Carcassonne.
The diapers illustrated indicate the variety of geometric pattern
to be found at Bourges, Chartres, Le Mans, and Notre Dame
at Paris, and elsewhere. In proportion as there is in them a preponderance
of blue and ruby the effect is that of an aggressive
purple. The safest plan seems to be in associating with the
blue plenty of green, or with the ruby plenty of yellow glass;
or a similar result may be obtained by the choice of a deep
neutral blue and of an orange shade of red, taking care always
that the two contrasting colours shall not be of anything like
equal strength.</p>

<p>At the best these diapers compare very unfavourably with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
scrollwork. They are, in the nature of things, more monotonous and less
interesting than a growth of foliage; they are apt also to run to gaudy
colour, which by its mass overpowers the pictures set in it. Compare, in
any French church, the windows in which there is geometric mosaic and
those in which there is scrollwork; and, though they may be all of the
same period, and presumably the work of the same men, you will almost
certainly have to marvel how artists who at one moment hold you
spellbound by the magic of their colour can in the next disturb your
eyesight with a glare of purple produced by the parody of a Scotch
plaid. Many of these diapers are very minute in scale; the smaller the
scale on which they are designed the greater the certainty of the
colours running together.</p>

</div>

<p>It is to the very small scale of the figures, also, that the
confusion of effect in medallion subjects, in spite of their comparatively
flat treatment, is to be attributed. At Bourges, at
Canterbury, everywhere, the medallion subjects are on far too
minute a scale to be made out by mortals of ordinary patience,
or, to speak accurately, impatience. Often, even in windows
which come close enough to the eye for study, it is only the
more conventionally familiar pictures which explain themselves
readily; and those you recognise almost by anticipation. You
have no difficulty in deciphering the Nativity, the Crucifixion,
the Ascension, and so on, because you expect to find them.
A certain muddle of effect must be accepted as characteristic
of medallion windows.</p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at, that, considering the difficulty
of making out the ordinary medallion subjects in the lower
windows, where they are usually found, some other scheme of
composition should have been adopted for clerestory windows
where those would have been more than ever unintelligible.
Accordingly, in that position, the single figure treatment was
adopted, and carried further than in the preceding century.
The figure was now, not for the first time, but more invariably,
enclosed in something like an architectural niche&mdash;a practice
borrowed from the sculptor, who habitually protected the carved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
figures enriching the portals of great churches by a projecting
canopy, giving them at the same time a pedestal or base of
some kind to stand upon.</p>

<p>In glass there was clearly no occasion for such architectural shelter or
support; but the pretended niche and base offered a means of occupying
the whole length of the space within the border, which, without some
additional ornament, would often have been too long in proportion to the
figure, the mere band of inscription under its feet not being enough to
fill out the length. These very rudimentary canopies, specimens of which
are given here, are usually very insignificant. It takes sometimes an
expert to realise that the broken colour about the head of the saint
(<a href="#Fig_30">page 46</a>) stands for architecture. The forms, when you come to look at
them closely, may be ugly as well as childish, but they go for so little
that it seems hardly worth while to take exception to them. It is only
as indication of a practice (later to be carried to absurd excess) of
making shift with sham architecture for the ornamental setting necessary
to bring the figure into relation and into proportion with the window it
is to occupy, that the device of thus enshrining a figure as yet
deserves attention. As the beginning of canopy work in glass it marks a
very eventful departure in design. All that need here be said about the
Early Gothic canopy is that it would have been easy to have devised
decorative forms at once more frankly ornamental, more interesting in
themselves, and more beautiful, not to say less suggestive of a child&#8217;s
building with a box of bricks.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 137px;">
<a id="Fig_84" name="Fig_84"></a>
<img src="images/fig_84.png" width="137" height="300" alt="Lyons." title="Lyons." />
<span class="caption">84. <span class="smcap">Lyons.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Sometimes, as at Chartres and elsewhere, the base of the canopy would
itself take the form of a little subordinate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> niche enclosing a
figure in small of the Donor, or perhaps only of his shield of arms.
Sometimes it would take the form of a panel of inscription, boldly
leaded in yellow letters upon blue or ruby.</p>

<p>An alternative idea was to represent the Saints, or other holy
personages, sitting. The figure on <a href="#Fig_84">page 135</a> belongs actually to
the beginning of the fourteenth century; but, except for a slightly
more naturalistic character in the drawing of the drapery, it
might almost have belonged to the same period as the standing
figure on <a href="#Fig_30">page 46</a>. In longer lights two saints are often
figured, sitting one above the other. This may be seen in the
clerestory at Canterbury; but the effect is usually less satisfactory
than that of the single figure on a larger scale. The
standing position is also much better suited to the foreshortened
view which one necessarily gets of clerestory windows. A curious
variation upon the ordinary theme occurs in four of the huge
lancets in the south transept at Chartres, where the Major
Prophets are represented each bearing on his shoulders an
Evangelist. The same idea recurs at Notre Dame, Paris, under
the south rose. That is all very well in idea&mdash;iconographically
it is only right that the Old Testament should uphold the New&mdash;but
reduced to picture it is absurd, especially as the Evangelists
are drawn to a smaller scale than the Prophets, and irresistibly
suggest boys having a ride upon their fathers&#8217; shoulders.
Dignity of effect there can be none. Not now for the first time,
seemingly, is art sacrificed to what we call the literary idea.</p>

<p>It shakes one&#8217;s faith somewhat in the sincerity of the early
medi√¶val artist to find that in the serried ranks of Kings,
Prophets, Bishops, and other holy men, keeping guard over the
church in the clerestory lights, one figure often does duty for a
variety of personages, the colour only, and perhaps the face,
being changed. At Reims there are as many as six in a
row, all precisely of the same pattern, though the fraud may
not be detected until one examines them from the triforium
gallery. At Lyons, again, it looks as if the same thing
occurred; but one cannot get near enough to them to be quite
certain. None the less they are fine in colour. Thirteenth
century glass was capable of great things in the way of colour;
and the rows of Kings and Prophets looking down upon you
from the clerestory of a great church like Bourges, archaic
though the drawing be, are truly solemn and imposing.</p>

<p>With grisaille glass begins a new chapter in the history of
glass painting, and a most important one&mdash;not only because
of the beautiful work which was done from the first in white,
but also because coloured glass grew, so to speak, always
towards the light.</p>

<p>The first coloured windows were intense in colour, rich, and even heavy.
The note they struck was deep, solemn, suited to the church and to the
times. Neither priest nor parishioner was afraid to sacrifice a certain
amount of light. It was the business of a window to shut in those that
worshipped from the outer world, and wrap them in mysterious and
beautiful gloom. With other days, however, came other ideals. As time
went on, and men emerged from the dark ages, the problem of the glazier
was how more and more to lighten his glass; until at last white glass
predominated, and the question was how to introduce colour into it.
Meanwhile the thirteenth century glaziers resorted, where they wanted
light, to the use of windows in grisaille, in absolute contrast to the
rich picture-glass in the same church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
The model for grisaille design was readily found in the earlier pattern
work in plain glazing.</p>

<span class="caption">88. <span class="smcap">S. Jean-aux-Bois.</span></span>
</div>

<p>This last never quite went out of use. But already in the thirteenth
century, and probably in the twelfth, it began to be supplemented, for
the most part, by painting. The exceptionally graceful work at S. Serge,
Angers, for example, on this page and the last, is probably not very
much later than the year 1200. You can see at a glance how this is only
a carrying further of the unpainted work in the same church (<a href="#Fig_17">page 27</a>)
attributed to the thirteenth century. There may be found indeed amidst
the plain glazing scraps of painted work; but they never happen to fit,
and have pretty certainly found their way into the window in course of
repairs. The unpainted window seems to be of greener and more silvery
glass than the painted, to which perhaps the cross-hatching gives a
rather horny look.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
The one way of painting grisaille in the thirteenth century was to trace
the design (which of course followed the traditional lines) boldly upon
the white glass, and then to cross-hatch the ground, more or less
delicately according to the scale of the work and its distance from the
eye, as here shown. By this means the pattern was made to stand out
clear and light against the background, which had now the value of a
tint, only a much more brilliant one than could have been got by a film
or wash of colour. Very occasionally a feature, such as the group of
four crowns which form the centre of the circle, <a href="#Fig_88">above</a>, might be
emphasised by filling in the ground about them in solid pigment; but
that was never done to any large extent. The rule was always to
cross-hatch the ground.</p>

<span class="caption">90. <span class="smcap">Early Detail.</span></span>
</div>

<p>With the introduction of colour into grisaille comes always the question
as to how much or how little of it there shall be. There is a good deal
of Early French work, which, on the face of it, was designed first as a
sort of strapwork of interlacing bands in plain glazing, and then
further enriched with painted work, not growing from it, except by way
of exception. This is seen in the example here given. The painter
indulged in slight modifications of detail as he went on. He had a model
which he copied more or less throughout the window; but he allowed
himself the liberty of playing variations, and he even departed from it
at times. By this means he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> adapted himself to the glass, which
did not always take just the same lines, and at the same time he amused
himself, and us, more than if he had multiplied one pattern with
monotonous precision. His painting was strong enough to keep the leads
in countenance; that is to say, his main outlines would be as thick (see
<a href="#Fig_90">opposite</a>) as lead lines.</p>

<p>Patterns such as those on <a href="#Fig_86">pages 138</a>, <a href="#Fig_88">139</a>, and <a href="#Fig_91">below</a>, from Soissons,
Reims, S. Jean-aux-Bois, would make good glazed windows apart from the
painting on them. Indeed, the painting is there comparatively
insignificant in design. In the Soissons work, in particular, it
consists of little more than cross-hatching upon the background, to
throw up the interlacing of the glazed bands; for, with the exception of
just a touch of colour in the one opposite, these designs are executed
entirely in white glass. The geometric glazing shapes so completely
convey the design, that the painted detail might almost be an
after-thought.</p>

<p>In much of the earliest grisaille there is absolutely no colour but the
greenish hue belonging to what we are agreed to call white glass, and
the effect of it is invariably so satisfactory as to show that colour is
by no means indispensable. And, at all events in France, the colour was
at first very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
sparingly used, except in those twelfth century patterns (<a href="#Fig_22">pages 35</a>, <a href="#Fig_65">118</a>,
<a href="#Fig_66">120</a>) which cannot fairly be called grisaille. In the window on <a href="#Fig_85">page 137</a>
the colour is, practically speaking, enclosed in small spaces
ingeniously contrived between the interlacing bands of white; in that on
<a href="#Fig_86">page 138</a> it is introduced in half rings, which form part of the marginal
line, and in spots or jewels; but in either case there is little of it,
and it is most judiciously introduced. The interlacing of bands of plain
white upon a ground of cross-hatching, itself enriched with scrollwork
clear upon it, is characteristically French. Similar bands of white
occur, though not interlacing, in the comparatively clumsy panel from
Lincoln (<a href="#Fig_93">above</a>), but the more usual English way was to make the bands of
white broader, and to paint a pattern upon them, as in the lancet from
Water Perry, Oxfordshire (<a href="#Fig_94">opposite</a>), or in the much more satisfactory
light from Lincoln (<a href="#Fig_95">overleaf</a>), leaving only a margin of clear glass next
the cross-hatched background. A similar kind of thing occurs in the
church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> of S. Pierre at Chartres (<a href="#Fig_96">below</a>). A yet more usual plan
with us was to make the strapwork in colour, as at Salisbury. In the
patterns on this page the straps do not interlace. In that on <a href="#Fig_97">page 143</a>
they not only interlace one with the other, but the painted ornament,
which now takes the form of more elaborate scrollwork than heretofore,
is intertwined with them. This is an extremely good example of Early
English grisaille. Altogether Salisbury Cathedral is rich in white glass
windows of this period (<a href="#Fig_97">pages 143</a>, <a href="#Fig_102">148</a>, <a href="#Fig_221">329</a>, <a href="#Fig_225">332</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>The grisaille in the clerestory at Bourges is similar to the Salisbury
work, but it is not possible to get near enough to it to make careful
comparison. The scrollwork on <a href="#Fig_97">page 143</a> may be profitably compared with
the very unusual white window at S. Jean-aux-Bois (<a href="#Fig_100">overleaf</a>). There the
design consists altogether of scrolls in white upon a cross-hatched
ground. It is as if the designer had set out to glaze up a pattern in
white upon a white ground, cross-hatched. But it is obvious that, as
there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><br /><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> no change of colour, it was no longer necessary always to
cut the ornament out of a separate piece of glass from the ground. We
find consequently that, wherever it is convenient, a painted line is
used to save leading. That, it has been already explained (<a href="#Page_24">page 24</a>), was
a practice from the first; and it was resorted to more and more. It came
in very conveniently in the French windows, in which the design
consisted largely of white strapwork. It was adopted in the example from
Ch√¢lons <a href="#Fig_98">here given</a>, though it does not appear in the sketch, any more
than it does in the glass until you examine it very carefully. However,
in the sketches from the great clerestory window from Reims Cathedral
(<a href="#Fig_99">overleaf</a>), and in the smaller one from S. Jean-aux-Bois (<a href="#Fig_100">facing it</a>),
the economy of glazing is easy to perceive; whilst in that from
Coutances (<a href="#Fig_101">page 147</a>) the glazier is already so sparing of his leads that
they no longer always follow or define the main lines of the pattern.</p>

<p>In a remarkable window in the choir of Chartres Cathedral (<a href="#Fig_103">page 150</a>) the
design includes interlacing bands both of white and colour, the coloured
ones flanked with strips of white; but the white bands are not glazed
separately. They are throughout included in the same piece of glass as
the cross-hatching, which defines them. This ingenious and very graceful
pattern window is still of the thirteenth century, though clearly of
much later date than, for example, the windows of S. Jean-aux-Bois,
which might indeed almost belong to the twelfth.</p>

</div>

<p>In several of the Salisbury windows (<a href="#Fig_102">pages 148</a>, <a href="#Fig_251">386</a>) thin
straps of colour are bounded on the outer side by broader bands
of white painted with pattern. And here it should be noticed
the bands no longer interlace at all; on the contrary, the
ornamental forms are superposed one upon the other. This is
very markedly the case on <a href="#Fig_102">page 148</a>. In the centre of the light
is a series of circular discs, and at the sides of these a row of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
zigzags, which, as it were, disappear behind them, whilst at
the edges of the window, again, is an array of segments of
smaller circles losing themselves behind these. In such cases,
it will be seen, the broad white bands fulfil the very useful
purpose of keeping the coloured lines apart, and separating
one series of shapes from the other. In this window, as in the
narrow light on <a href="#Fig_251">page 386</a>, where the vesica shape is occupied
once more with flowing scrollwork, and as in all but one of
the windows on that page, the background of cross-hatching
is for the first time omitted, and the pencilled pattern is by so
much the less effective. As a rule, patterns traced in mere
outline like this belong to a later date; but these windows are
certainly of the thirteenth century. It is seldom safe to say
that this or that practice belonged exclusively to any one
period. The white glass on <a href="#Fig_227">page 335</a>, almost entirely without
paint, might have been executed in the twelfth century, but its
border indicates more likely the latter part of the thirteenth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Quite the simplest form of glazing was to lead the glass together
in squares or diamonds. These &#8220;quarries,&#8221; as they are called
(from the French <i>carr√©</i>) are associated sometimes with rosettes
and bands of other pattern work, as at Lincoln (<a href="#Fig_189">pages 284</a>, <a href="#Fig_192">287</a>);
but more ordinarily the ornamental part of the window is made
up entirely of them. &#8220;Quarry&#8221; is a term to be remembered.
It plays in the next century an important part in the design
of windows.</p>

<p>The best-known grisaille windows in England are the famous
group of long lancets, ending the north transept of York Minster,
which are known by the name of the Five Sisters.
You remember the legend about them. The &#8220;inimitable
Boz&#8221; relates it at length in &#8220;Nicholas Nickleby&#8221;; but it is
nonsense, all the same. The story tells how in the reign of
Henry the Fourth five maiden ladies worked the designs in
embroidery, and sent them abroad to be carried out in glass.
But, as it happens, they belong to the latter part of the
thirteenth century; they are unmistakably English work; and,
what is more, no woman, maiden, wife, or widow, ever had,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
or could have had, a hand in their design. Their authorship is written
on the face of them. Every line in their composition shows them to be
the work of a strong man, and a practical glazier, who worked according
to the traditions that had come down to him. A designer recognises in it
a man who knew his trade, and knew it thoroughly. The notion that any
glazier ever worked from an embroidered design is too absurd. As well
might the needlewoman go to the glazier to design her stitchery. But
such is the popular ignorance of workmanship, and of its intimate
connection with design, that no doubt the vergers will go on repeating
their apocryphal tale as long as vergers continue to fill the office of
personal conductors.</p>

<p>The Five Sisters are rather looser and freer in design than the
Salisbury glass, and have broad borders of white. In detail they are
certainly not superior to that, nor in general design, so far as one can
make it out at all; but, from their very size and position, they produce
a much more imposing effect. Whoever is not impressed by the Five
Sisters is not likely ever to be moved by grisaille. They form one huge
fivefold screen of silvery glass. The patterns are only with great
difficulty to be deciphered. It is with these as with many others of the
most fascinating windows in grisaille; the glass is corroded on the
surface, black with the dirt and lichen of ages, cracked and crossed
with leads introduced by the repairing glazier, until the design is
about as intelligible as would be a conglomeration of huge spiders&#8217;
webs. But, for all that, nay, partly because of it, it is a thing of
absolute <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a><br /><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><br /><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>beauty, as beautiful as a spider&#8217;s
web, beaded with dewdrops, glistening in the sun on a frosty winter&#8217;s
morning. It is a dream of silvery light: who cares for details of
design? But it is all this, because it was designed, because it was
planned by a glazier for glazing, and has all that gives glass its
charm.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<br />
WINDOWS OF MANY LIGHTS.</h3>

<p>The merry life of the medallion window was a short one. It
reigned during the Early Gothic period supreme; but after the
end of the thirteenth century it soon went quite out of fashion,
and with it the practice of shaping the bars to suit the pattern
of the window&mdash;a practice, it will have been noticed, not followed
in grisaille windows, though it might very well have been.</p>

<p>With the change which came over the spirit of later thirteenth
century architecture some new departure in the design of glass
became inevitable. The windows spoken of till now were all
single lights, broader or narrower, as the case might be, but each
so far off from the other that it had to be complete in itself, and
might just as well be designed with no more than general
reference to its neighbours. But in time it began to be felt in
France that the broad Norman window was too broad, and so
they divided it into two by a central shaft, or mullion as it is
called, of stone. In England equally it began to be felt that
the long narrow lancet lights were too much in the nature of
isolated piercings in the bare wall, and so the builder brought
them closer and closer together, until they also were divided
by narrow mullions.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<a id="Fig_104" name="Fig_104"></a>
<img src="images/fig_104.png" width="250" height="203" alt="Decorated Medallion Window" title="Decorated Medallion Window" />
<span class="caption">104. <span class="smcap">Decorated Medallion Window, German.</span></span>
</div>

<p>In this way, and in answer especially to the growing demand
for more light in churches, and consequently for more windows,
it became the custom to group them. Eventually the window
group resolved itself into a single window of several, sometimes
of many, lights, divided only by narrow stone mullions. Or, to
account for it in another way, windows of considerable size
coming into vogue, it became necessary, for constructional no
less than for artistic reasons, to subdivide them by mullions into
two or more lights. The arched window head was broken up
into smaller fancifully shaped &#8220;tracery&#8221; lights, as they are called;
and so we arrive at the typical &#8220;Decorated&#8221; Gothic window.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 184px;">
<a id="Fig_105" name="Fig_105"></a>
<img src="images/fig_105.png" width="184" height="250" alt="Freiburg." title="Freiburg." />
<span class="caption">105. <span class="smcap">Freiburg.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The height of these windows being naturally in proportion to
their width, the separate lights into which they were divided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
were apt to be exceedingly long. To have treated them after the Early
medallion manner, each with its broad border, would have been to draw
attention to this, and even to exaggerate their length. The problem now
to be solved in glass was, how best to counteract the effect of
insecurity likely to result from the thinness of the upright lines of
the stone and the narrowness of the openings between them. It is not
meant to say that the medallion window expired without a spasm. For a
while Decorated windows were treated very much after the fashion of the
earlier medallion windows. The medallions were necessarily smaller, and
usually long in proportion to their width, although they extended now to
the edge of the stonework, the narrowish border to the lights passing,
as it were, behind them. This is very amply illustrated in the windows
in the choir clerestory at Tours. Occasionally there is no border but a
line of white and colour, and the whole interval between the elongated
hexagonal or octagonal panels is given up to mosaic diaper. The
medallions naturally range themselves in horizontal order throughout the
three or four lights of the window, giving just the indication of a
horizontal line across them. By way of exception, the subject of the
Last Supper extends through all three lights of the East window, the
tablecloth forming a conspicuous band of light across it. This glass at
Tours is deep and rich throughout, as intense sometimes as in earlier
work, though warmer in colour, owing to the greater amount of yellow
glass employed. That was not to last long.</p>

<p>It lingered longest in Germany. There is a curious two-light
window in Cologne Cathedral, with queer rectangular
medallions, of considerable interest, which is probably not
very early in date. A not very common type of Decorated
medallion window is illustrated <a href="#Fig_104">above</a>. The cutting across the
border by medallion or other subjects, is a common thing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
fourteenth century glass (<a href="#Fig_105">below</a> and <a href="#Fig_104">opposite</a>), just because
such encroachment is obviously a most useful device in dealing
with narrow spaces. It occurs in some medallion windows
(also of the fourteenth century) at the church of Santa Croce,
at Florence.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 348px;">

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">106. DETAILS OF DEC. GERMAN GLASS.</span></p>

<p>But this was not enough. The Germans went a step further, and carried
the medallions boldly across two lights, treating them as a single
medallion window with a stone mullion instead of an iron bar up the
centre. There is an instance of this at S. Sebald&#8217;s Church, Nuremberg,
and another, more curious than beautiful to see, at Strassburg. They
went further still, and carried the medallions across a three-light
window. There is one such at Augsburg, where the medallions almost fill
the window, extending to the extreme edge of the outer lights. Indeed, a
broad outer border of angels surrounding the great circles is cut short
by the side walls. This is at least a means of getting rid of the
littleness resulting sometimes from the small medallion treatment, and
it is in fact most effective. The broad, sweeping, circular lines also
have the appearance of holding the lights together and strengthening
them.</p>

<span class="caption">107. <span class="smcap">Typical Decorated Canopy.</span></span>
</div>

<p>This was a thing most needful to be done in Decorated glass. It was
needed sometimes already in Early work. At Clermont-Ferrand the narrow
lancets at the end of the South transept are filled, except for a thin
white beaded border, with diaper work in rich colour, interrupted at
intervals by big rosettes of white, which form two bands of light across
the series, and make them seem one group.</p>

<p>The deliberate use of horizontal lines (or features giving such lines)
in glass, was clearly the most effective way of counteracting the too
upright tendency of the masonry, or rather of preventing it from
appearing unduly drawn out; and it became the custom. Even in a
comparatively small Decorated window, for example, the figures would
usually form a band across it, distinguished from the ornamental
shrinework <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a><br /><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>above and below it by a marked difference
in colour. In a taller window there would be two, or possibly three,
such bands of figures, in marked contrast to their framing. In Germany
very often one big frame would cross the window, or the figure subjects
would be separated&mdash;as at Strassburg, for example&mdash;by bands of
arcading, out of which peeped little saints each with a descriptive
label in his hand.</p>

</div>

<p>A typical English canopy of the period is given on <a href="#Fig_107">this page</a>. It was
commonly enclosed, as here shown, within a border, wide enough to be
some sort of acknowledgment of the subdivision of the window, but not
wide enough to prevent the colour of the canopy from forming a distinct
band across the window. The predominance of a powerful, rather brassy,
yellow in the canopy work, and a contrast in colour between its
background and that of the figures, carried the eye without fail across
the window. A notable exception to the usual brassiness of the Decorated
canopy occurs at Toulouse, where a number of high-pitched gables of the
ordinary design, stronger in colour than usual, have crockets and
finials of a fresh bright green.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 95px;">

</div>

<p>The Decorated canopy, with its high-pitched gable and tall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
flying buttresses, its hard lines, and its brassy colour was a
characteristic, but never a very beautiful feature in design; and it
grew to quite absurd proportions. It was in Germany that it was carried
to greatest excess, extending to a height three or four times that of
the figure and more; but with us also it was commonly tall enough
altogether to dwarf the poor little figure it pretended to protect. Even
when it was not preposterously tall, its detail was usually out of all
proportion to the figure. Your fourteenth century draughtsman would have
no hesitation in making the finial of his canopy bigger than the head
(nimbus and all) of the saint under it. Clumsiness of this kind is so
much the rule, and disproportion is so characteristic of the middle of
the fourteenth century, that, but for some distinctly good ornamental
glass of the period, one might dismiss it as merely transitional, and
not worthy of a chapter to itself in the history of glass design.</p>

<span class="caption">110. <span class="smcap">Executioner of S. John the
Baptist, 14th Century.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Our distinctions of style, as was said, are at the best arbitrary. We
may devise a classification which shall serve to distinguish one marked
type from another, but it is quite impossible to draw any hard-and-fast
line between the later examples of one kind and the earlier of another
one. We may choose to divide Gothic art into three classes, as we
may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> subdivide the spectrum into so many positive colours, but
the indeterminate shades by which they gradate each into the other defy
classification or description.</p>

<p>Certainly the best figure work of the middle period is that which might
quite fairly be claimed as belonging, on the one hand, to the end of the
Early, or on the other to the beginning of the Late, Gothic period. In
the figures from Troyes, for example (<a href="#Fig_31">page 47</a> and <a href="#Fig_108">opposite</a>), the Early
tradition lingers; in those from New College (also <a href="#Fig_109">opposite</a>) the
characteristics of Late work begin to appear. In the figure of the
headsman on this page there is certainly no sense of proportion. In all
the wealth of Decorated figure-and-canopy work at York Minster there is
nothing to rank for a moment with the best Early or Perpendicular glass.
Nor in France, though there is Decorated work in most of the great
churches, is there anything conspicuously fine. Even at S. Ouen, at
Rouen, there is nothing particularly worthy of note. It is true that the
period of the English occupation and the troubles which followed it was
not the time when we should expect the arts to flourish there.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">111. <span class="smcap">Decorated Borders.</span></span></p>

<p>A most characteristic thing in glass of this intermediate
period was the way in which colour and grisaille were
associated. It has been already told how, before then, white
and colour had been used together in the same light&mdash;at
Auxerre, for example, where, within a broad border of colour,
you find an inner frame of grisaille, enclosing a central figure
panel of colour. Quite at the beginning of the fourteenth century,
if not already at the end of the thirteenth, you find, as at
S. Radegonde, Poitiers, upon a ground of grisaille, coloured
medallion subjects, or more happily still, little figures, as it were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
inlaid, breaking the white surface very pleasantly with patches
of unevenly but judiciously dispersed colour&mdash;the whole enclosed
in a coloured border. But in the fourteenth century the more
even combination of white and colour was quite a common
thing. Naturally it was introduced in the form of the
horizontal bands already mentioned. And indeed it is in
windows into which grisaille enters that this band-wise distribution
of design is most apparent, and most typical. The
designer very commonly conceived his window as in grisaille,
crossed by a band or bands of colour, binding the lights together.
That may be seen in the chapter-house at York, where you
have several series of little subjects, more or less in the shape
of medallions, forming so many belts of colour across the
five-light grisaille windows, which belts the eye insensibly
follows right round the building.</p>

<p>That is the theory of design. Its practical construction may
be better described otherwise. The iron horizontal bars, to
the use of which the glaziers had by this time come back,
divide the lights each into a series of panels, which panels are
filled at York alternately with coloured subjects and ornamental
grisaille. Elsewhere perhaps two panels are filled with colour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a><br /><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>to one of grisaille, or three to one, or <i>vice vers√¢</i>. In any case
these alternate panels of white and colour, occurring always
on the same level throughout the lights composing the window
(and often through all the windows along the aisle of a church),
range themselves in pronounced horizontal strips or bands.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 403px;">
<a id="Fig_112" name="Fig_112"></a>

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">112. GRISAILLE AND FIGURE.</span></p>

<p>This acceptance of the bars as a starting-point in design, and this
deliberate counterchange of light and dark, may appear to indicate a
very rough-and-ready scheme of design. But any brutality there might be
in it is done away with by the introduction of a sufficient amount of
white into the coloured bands and of a certain modicum of colour in the
bands of white. And that was habitually the plan adopted. Into the
subjects it was easy to introduce just as much white as seemed
necessary. A little white might be there already in the flesh, which was
no longer always represented in flesh-coloured glass but more and more
commonly in white. The usual border at the sides of the
grisaille&mdash;now reduced to quite modest proportions&mdash;perhaps a
simple leaf border, as on <a href="#Fig_29">pages 44</a>, <a href="#Fig_111">158</a>, perhaps a still simpler &#8220;block&#8221;
border, as <a href="#Fig_113">above</a>, served to frame the white, at the same time that it
was an acknowledgment once more of the fact that each light forms a
separate division of the window. In most cases the introduction of a
little colour into the grisaille panel, very often in the form of a
rosette, went further to prevent any possible appearance of
disconnection between the figures and their ornamental setting. As a
matter of fact, so little obvious is the plan of such windows in the
actual glass that it often takes one some time to perceive it.</p>

<span class="caption">113. <span class="smcap">Evreux.</span></span>
</div>

<p>In the nave at York Minster the grisaille is crossed by two
bands of coloured figure work. Elsewhere it is crossed by one;
but where the figures have canopies, as they often have, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
makes again a horizontal subdivision in the coloured portion
of the glass. Sometimes the topmost pinnacles of the coloured
canopies will extend into the grisaille above, breaking the
harshness of the dividing line; but it is seldom that it appears
harsh in the glass. The fact seems to be that the upward
tendency of the long lights is so marked, and the mullions
make such a break in any cross line, that there is no fear
of horizontal forms pronouncing themselves too strongly; the
difficulty is rather to make them marked enough. Architects
came eventually to feel the want of some more sternly
horizontal feature than the glazier could contrive, when they
introduced the stone transom, which was a feature of the later
Gothic period.</p>

<p>When it was a question of glazing a broad single light of
earlier construction, the fourteenth century artist designed his
glass accordingly. Not that he then adopted the thirteenth
century manner&mdash;it never entered his mind to work in any other
style than that which was current in his day; the affectation of
bygone styles is a comparatively modern heresy&mdash;but he adapted
his design equally to help, if not to correct, the shape of the
window opening. Accustomed as he was to narrower lights, the
broad window of an earlier age appeared to him unduly broad,
and his first thought was to make it look narrower. This he did
by dividing it into vertical (instead of horizontal) strips of white
and colour. That is shown in the window from Troyes (<a href="#Fig_112">page
159</a>), in which the centre strip of the window, occupied by figures
and canopies in colour, is flanked by broad strips of grisaille,
and that again by a coloured border. There, as usual, you find
some white in the figure work and some colour in the grisaille,
always the surest way of making the window look one.</p>

<p>The judicious treatment of a belated lancet window like this
goes to show that it was of set purpose that the tall lights of a
Decorated window were bound together by ties of coloured
glass. So long as windows were built in many lights, that plan
of holding them together was never abandoned. There is a
very notable instance of this at Berne, where the four long lights
of a Late Gothic window are crossed by lines of canopy work,
taking not horizontal but arched lines (a device common enough
in German glass), effectually counteracting the lean and lanky
look of the window. Still markedly horizontal lines of subdivision
in glass design are more characteristic of the second
Gothic period than of any other.</p>

MIDDLE GOTHIC GLASS.</h3>

<p>Towards the fourteenth century, it seems, a wave of realism
swept over Gothic art. So much is this so that a relatively
speaking naturalistic form of ornamental detail is the most
marked feature of the Decorated period, giving it its name, and,
indeed, its claim to be a style.</p>

<p>No great stress has been laid in the foregoing chapters upon this new
departure in naturalism, because it did not so very vitally affect
design. When it is said that glass followed always the fashion of
architecture, that is as much as to say that, as the sculptors took to
natural instead of conventional foliage, so did the glass painters; and
there is not much more to tell. To trace the development of naturalistic
design would lead us far astray. Enough to say that, by the naturalistic
turn of its ornamental foliage you may recognise the period called
&#8220;Decorated.&#8221; How far that naturalism of Decorated detail may be to the
good is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> question there is no need here to dispute. It was a
new departure. The new work lacked something of the simple dignity and
self-restraint which marked the earlier, and it had not yet the style
and character which came in the next century of more consistently
workmanlike treatment. In so far it was a kind of prelude to
Perpendicular work. This is not to deny that excellent work was done in
the Decorated period, especially perhaps in glass, where naturalism, at
its crudest, is less offensive than in wood or stone. But there is no
getting over the fact that the period was intermediate; and Decorated
glass is in a state of transition (1) between the archaism of the early
and the accomplishment of the later Gothic; (2) between the conventional
ornament which merely suggests nature and natural foliage conventionally
treated; (3) between strong rich colour and delicate silvery glass. The
transition of style is nowhere more plainly to be traced than in the
grisaille of the period. At first the character of fourteenth century
grisaille did not greatly differ from earlier work, except in the form
of the painted detail. That from S. Urbain, Troyes, on <a href="#Fig_226">page 333</a>, is a
typical instance of Early French Transition foliage, in which the scroll
is only less strong and vigorous than before. Precisely the same kind of
detail is shown again in the lower of the two instances, likewise from
Troyes, <a href="#Fig_116">opposite</a>; but already natural leaves begin to mingle with it;
whilst in the illustration above it, though the mosaic border is
characteristically early, the foliage in grisaille is deliberately
naturalistic. The grisaille at Troyes, by the way, often reminds one of
that at York Minster. It is mainly by the naturalistic character of the
ivy scroll, or perhaps it would be nearer the mark to say of the leaves
upon it, that the design from Norbury, Derbyshire (<a href="#Fig_114">page 162</a>), betrays
its later date, by that and the absence of cross-hatching on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>background. The glazing of the window is still thoroughly
mosaic.</p>

<p>There is a different indication of transition in the little panel
from S. Pierre at Chartres, almost entirely in white glass, on
<a href="#Fig_115">page 163</a>. The foliated ornament is here still early in character;
but, it will be seen, there is no longer any pretence of leading
up the bands of clear glass in separate strips. They are only
bounded on one side by a lead line. That is so again in the
three designs from Chartres Cathedral <a href="#Fig_117">above</a>, where, further,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the background is clear of paint; and in those from Evreux,
on <a href="#Fig_118">pages 165</a>, <a href="#Fig_190">284</a>. There the background is cross-hatched;
but in one case the foliage is naturalistic.</p>

<p>The coloured strapwork in the grisaille from the Lady Chapel of Rouen
Cathedral on <a href="#Fig_119">page 165</a> is frankly mosaic; but the foliated ends of the
straps, gathered together into a central quatrefoil in a quite unusual
fashion, indicates the new spirit. The white glass is there painted with
trailing foliage in outline upon a clear ground, not shown in the
sketch, which is merely a diagram of the glazing. The grisaille from
Stanton S. John, Oxford, here given, still hesitates rather between two
opinions. The foliage is naturalistic, but the background is
cross-hatched; the broad diagonal bands, patterned with paint, are
glazed in colour; the rings of white are not separately leaded. That
sort of thing has occurred, as already pointed out, before; but it was
not till the fourteenth century, or thereabouts, that the strapwork of
white lines, forming so characteristic a feature in Decorated grisaille,
are systematically indicated by painted outlines and not glazed in if it
could be helped.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">

<span class="caption">120. <span class="smcap">Stanton S. John, Oxford.</span></span>
</div>

<p>You have only to examine the crossing of the white lines
in any of these last-mentioned patterns to see that, now that
they are not separately glazed, they do not really interlace
as before. It is out of the question that they should.</p>

<p>It is easy enough to glaze up bands so that they shall interlace; but,
when some of the drawing lines are lead and some paint, it occurs
continually that you want a leaded line to pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> behind a line
of clear glass&mdash;which, of course, is a physical impossibility. It
follows that the pretended interlacing comes to grief. The pattern is
confused (it is worse when there is no hatched background) by the
occurrence of leads, stronger than the painted lines, which, so far from
playing any part in the design, occur just at the points where they most
interfere with it.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 188px;">
<a id="Fig_121" name="Fig_121"></a>

<span class="caption">121. <span class="smcap">Ch√¢lons.</span></span>
</div>

<p>That this did not deter them, that they made a shift with interlacing
which does not truly interlace, marks a falling off in what may be
called the conscientiousness of the Gothic designers. French and English
Decorated grisaille, effective as it often is in the window, is
distinctly less satisfactory in design than the common run of earlier
work. Its charm is never in its detail.</p>

<p>The patterns may be ingenious and not without grace, but they are never
altogether admirable, any more than are the figures.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 149px;">

<span class="caption">122. <span class="smcap">Ch√¢lons.</span></span>
</div>

<p>What you most enjoy in it is the distribution of white and colour; and
you enjoy it most when you do not too curiously examine into the detail
of the design, when you are satisfied to enjoy the colour, and do not
look for form, which after all is of less account in glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>So far as effect only is concerned, quarry work, the mere glazing in
squares, answers in many places (such, for example, as the clerestories
of narrow churches, where you could not possibly enjoy any detail of
design that might be there) all the purpose of grisaille; and it was
commonly resorted to. But the painting upon such quarries counts for
very little; it is far too small and fine in detail to have any effect
further than to tone the glass a little, which would have been
unnecessary if the glass employed had been less clear. In fact, delicate
paint on distant clerestory glass is much ado about very little; and one
cannot help thinking that plain glazing would there have answered all
the purpose of the most delicately painted pattern work. The fourteenth
century glaziers seldom complicated their quarry work by the
introduction of bands or straps of colour between the quarries, or by
the introduction of colour other than such as might occur in rosettes or
shields and so on, planted upon them, rather than worked into the
design. Occasionally, however, as at Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne, you come upon an
ornamental window (<a href="#Fig_121">page 167</a>) in which quarries are separated by bands of
clear white, a certain amount of colour being introduced in the form of
yellow quarries substituted at regular intervals for the white. On the
<a href="#Fig_122">same page</a> is another coloured diaper window designed on quarry lines,
also at Ch√¢lons. In that quarries of white and yellow are separated by a
trellis of blue. Something of the sort is to be seen also at S.
Radegonde, Poitiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
In these cases the painting, as will be seen, is strong enough
to hold its own at a considerable distance from the eye, but the
effect is not very happy. When, by the way, it was said that
delicate painting on distant quarries was lost, it was not meant
to imply that strong painting on quarries would be a happy
solution of the difficulty. As a matter of experience, it is seldom
satisfactory. On the other hand, the common expedient of
leading up the coloured backgrounds to figure work in small
squares of ruby, green, and so on, was generally the means of
securing good broken colour.</p>

<p>It can hardly be said that geometric pattern windows in strong
colour are ever very successful. The Germans, who, it should be
remembered, call their second Gothic period the &#8220;Geometric,&#8221;
often attempted it, but without conspicuous success.</p>

<p>In Germany it was customary to use geometric diaper work long after it
had gone out of use in France. In fact, it is there more likely a sign
of the second period. The crosslines in the diaper from Regensburg
(<a href="#Fig_123">opposite</a>) would have been in lead, not paint, if the work had been
executed in the thirteenth century; again, the diaper below it would not
at that period have been painted in the likeness of oak-leaves. Diaper
of this kind was not used merely to fill up between medallions, but as
background, for example, to canopy work. Frequently it was very small in
scale, as well as elaborate in pattern. It can hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> be said
that it was always worth the pains spent upon it&mdash;often it was not;
but the Germans avoided, as a rule, the dangerous red and blue
combination, and preferred, as did also the Italians, less stereotyped
arrangements of green and yellow, or of red and green, or of red and
green and yellow; if they ventured upon red and blue, it was with a
difference very much to their credit. For example, they would enclose
diamonds of ruby in bands of purple-brown, with just a point of blue at
the interstices; again, they would make a diaper of purple,
purple-brown, and grey; and in many another way show that they
deliberately aimed at colour in such work&mdash;whereas many of the
Early diapers suggest that the glazier was thinking more of pattern. An
instance of heraldic diaper is given on <a href="#Fig_125">page 169</a>.</p>

<p>In Italy also you find sometimes, as at Florence and Assisi, medallion
windows with mosaic diaper between, or mosaic diaper used as background
to figures which certainly cannot be described as Early.</p>

<p>The Germans differed from the rest of us in their frank use of geometric
pattern. We habitually disguised it more or less, clothing it most
likely with foliation; they used it quite nakedly, and were not ashamed.
Instances of this innocent use of geometric form are here given. At
Freiburg are quite a number of windows entirely of geometric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
pattern work. There is a good deal of white glass in them, but they
count rather for colour than for grisaille. It would not be quite unfair
to say they fall between the two stools. These designs are much more
pleasing in the glass than in black and white (where they have rather
too much the appearance of floor-cloth), but they are by no means the
happiest work of the Germans of that day. Where they were really most
successful, more successful than their contemporaries, was in foliated
or floral pattern windows, and those of a kind also standing dangerously
near midway between colour and grisaille. The method of execution
employed in them was to a large extent strictly mosaic; but there is
quite a refreshing variety and novelty, as well as very considerable
ingenuity, in their design.</p>

<p>The window from Regensburg on <a href="#Fig_252">page 389</a> sets out very much as if it were
going to be a grisaille window; but it has, in the first place, more
colour than is usual in grisaille, and, in the second, it will be seen
that the little triangular ground spaces next the border are filled with
pot-metal. The contrast of the set pattern and the four coloured leaves
crossing each circle with the flowing undergrowth of grisaille is
unusual, and so is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> the cunning alternation of cross-hatching
and plain white ground. The designs from Munich Museum on <a href="#Page_171">pages 171 to
174</a> have nothing in common with grisaille. The design consists of
natural foliage chiefly in white, growing tree-like upon a coloured
ground up the centre of the light. In the one the stem is waved, in the
other it takes a spiral form, in the third it is more naturalistic. But
nature is not very consistently followed. What appears like a vine on
<a href="#Fig_128">page 171</a> has husks or flowers which it is not easy to recognise; and the
ivy here is endowed with tendrils. The border of convolvulus leaves and
the hop scroll, <a href="#Fig_130">opposite</a>, are unmistakable, though there is some
inconsistency between the naturalness of the leaves and the stiffness of
their growth. The ivy pattern differs from the others inasmuch as the
leaves show light against the yellow ground, whilst the green stem and
stalks tell dark upon it, and there is a band of red within the outer
border which holds the rather spiky leaves together. The most
interesting window of this kind illustrated is that on <a href="#Fig_131">page 174</a>, in
which the stem is ingeniously twisted into quatrefoil medallion shapes,
so as to allow a change in the colour of the ground, and the leaves are
designed to go beyond the filling and form a pattern upon the border.
The rose is a hackneyed theme enough, but this at least is a new way of
working it out. Fourteenth century German windows are altogether more
varied in design than contemporary French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a><br />
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> or English work. The glass
is not so much all of one pattern. There are more surprises in it. The
Germans treated grisaille in a way very much their own. At the risk of a
certain coarseness of execution, they would paint out the background to
their natural foliage in solid pigment, or in brown just hatched with
lines scratched through to the clear glass. That is very effectively
done, for example, at the Church of S. Thomas at Strassburg. It is not
contended that this is at all a better plan than that practised in
France or England: it is on the whole less happy; but there are
positions in which it is more to the purpose; and it has at least the
merit of being different; it suggests something better than it
accomplishes, and it is a timely reminder that the best methods we know
of cannot be accepted as final.</p>

<p>Again at Regensburg there is some distant ornamental work, so simple in
execution that it is little more than glazing in colours; in fact just
what distant work should be&mdash;effective in its place without any
waste of labour.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 114px;">

<p>A word or two remains to be said about borders. The narrower decorated
light implied, as was said, a narrower border. It was, as a rule, only
when a wide Early window had to be glazed that there was room for a
broad one. In that case it showed of course the new naturalism, with
perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> the added interest of animal life, as
<a href="#Fig_132">here illustrated</a>; but there lingers in German borders such as this and
the one on <a href="#Fig_230">page 338</a>, something of early tradition. It looks as if it
would not be difficult to accept glazing lines like these and fill them
in with painted detail <i>√† la Romanesque</i>. In one of the windows in York
Minster there is a border of alternate leaves and monkeys, both much of
a size, which broadens out at the base, affording space for the
representation of a hunt, men, dogs, grass and all complete.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 73px;">
<a id="Fig_132" name="Fig_132"></a>

<span class="caption">132. <span class="smcap">14th Century German.</span></span>
</div>

<p>There was another reason for the adoption of a narrower border. Not only
were windows narrower now, but their arched heads were cusped, which
made it exceedingly difficult to carry any but the narrowest possible
border round them satisfactorily. It will be seen how awkwardly the
border fits (or does not fit) the window head on <a href="#Fig_107">page 155</a>. Even the
simplest border had to be very much distorted in order to make it follow
the line of the masonry; and, in any case, it gave a very ugly shape
within the border, and one again difficult to fill. Already, at the
beginning of the fourteenth century, the designer found it convenient to
run his border straight up into the cusped head of the light and let the
stonework cut it abruptly short; that occurs at Carcassonne. Sometimes,
as at Tewkesbury, the inconvenient border is allowed to end just above
the springing line of the arch, against a pinnacle of the canopy, beyond
which point there is only a line or two of white or colour, by way of
frame or finish to the background. An unusual but quite satisfactory way
of getting over the difficulty of carrying the border round the window
head is, to accept the springing line of the arch as the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
the central design, and to make the foliated border spread and fill the
entire window head above. Some quarry lights in the triforium at Evreux
are effectively treated in that manner.</p>

<p>Types of ordinary Decorated borders, English, French, and German, are
shown in this and the preceding chapter. The leafage springs from one
side or the other or from a central stem, or from either side of a
waving stem, or from two stems intertwined (<a href="#Fig_111">page 158</a>). Sometimes the
ground on one side is of a different colour from that on the other; in
any case the glazing is usually simple. One of the leaf borders at Rouen
Cathedral includes a series of little green birds; another, an oak
pattern, is inhabited at intervals by squirrels and wild men of the
woods. Rather interesting variations upon the ordinary type of border
are given on this and the preceding pages. The broader one <a href="#Fig_135">above</a> is of
distinctly unusual character, inasmuch as it has no background except
the painting out, and the colour of the leafage varies
quasi-accidentally.</p>

<p>The use of the rosette borders on <a href="#Fig_128">pages 171</a>, <a href="#Fig_129">172</a> is sufficiently
accounted for by the desire to get contrast to the foliated filling, but
it occurs at all periods more or less. So does the "block border"; but
for all that it is almost as characteristic of Decorated work as the
leaf border. It is seen in its simplest form on <a href="#Fig_98">page 144</a>. On <a href="#Fig_252">page 389</a> it
is associated with foliage and rosettes. A typical form of it is where
the blocks are charged with heraldic devices, which may serve to
indicate the date, or to confuse one. In the design from Evreux on <a href="#Fig_113">page
160</a> there occur, for example, the Fleurs-de-Lys of France alternating
with the Castle of Castille. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> particular charges occur
frequently in the windows of the S. Chapelle at Paris, and in the lights
from that source now in the South Kensington Museum; and they go perhaps
to show that Blanche of Castille (who married Louis VIII.) gave them to
the chapel, or that they were in her memory. She died in 1252. It is
most improbable that the Evreux glass should belong to so early a date
as that. Were it so, the occurrence of this kind of thing in such early
work would only go to show that heraldic devices are as old as heraldry,
and that when the glazier had a narrow light to fill he treated it as a
narrow light, with a border in proportion to its width: he certainly did
that at the S. Chapelle. The fact remains that this particular form of
&#8220;block&#8221; border marks, as a rule, the approach of the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>It may be as well to remind the reader that dates and periods
are only mentioned in order to save circumlocution. When
the thirteenth century is mentioned, it is not meant to convey
the year 1201, nor yet 1299, but the century in its prime. And,
what is more, it is not meant to say that the work ascribed to
that period was quite certainly and indisputably done after the
year 1200 or before the year 1300, but only that it bears the
mark of the century&mdash;which, from the present point of view, is
the important thing. The precise and certain year in which this
or that device was by exception for the first time employed, or
until which by chance a practically obsolete practice survived,
is interesting (if it can be ascertained) only as a question of
arch√¶ology. Anyway, a workman would rather believe the
evidence of his eyes, which he can trust, than of documents,
which, even if authentic, may not be trustworthy, and which are
perhaps open to misinterpretation.</p>

<p>Typically Decorated glass, apart from the ornamental windows
just referred to, is the least interesting of Gothic. There is in it a
straying from Early tradition without reaching the later freedom
and attainment. In colour it has neither the strength of the
Early work nor the delicacy of the Late. It marks some progress
in technique, but little in design, and none in taste.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<br />
LATE GOTHIC WINDOWS.</h3>

<p>The subdivision of art into periods is in reality the veriest
makeshift. To be on quite safe ground we should have, as
a matter of fact, to reduce our periods to not more than half
their supposed duration, and to class all the rest of the time as
belonging to intervals of transition.</p>

<p>The truth is, it is always a period of transition. The stream
moves perpetually on; there are only moments in its course
when it seems to move more slowly, and we have time to fix
its characteristics. It follows that, if we divide our periods
according to time, we have to include within them work of
very various character; and if we divide them according to
style, our dates get hopelessly confused.</p>

<p>Some sort of classification is necessary in order to emphasise
changes which actually took place only by degrees, and are perceptible
only to the expert. But no sooner do we begin to classify,
than we find so many exceptions, that we are inclined almost to
wonder if they do not form the rule. All that has been said,
therefore, and may yet be said, about the periods of design,
must be taken with more than a grain of suspicion. For
example, what shall be said about the great East window at
Gloucester Cathedral, which Winston instances as a typical
example of Decorated glass? Doubtless the technique is that
of soon after the middle of the fourteenth century, and the
detail of the canopies, when you come to examine them, is
more nearly Decorated than anything else; but the first impression
of the glass is quite that of Perpendicular work. This
may come partly of the circumstances that the masonry of
the window follows already distinctly Perpendicular lines; but
it comes much more from the colour of the glass and its
distribution. It is not merely that blue and ruby backgrounds
are carried straight up through the long lengths of each alternate
light, or that the blue is lighter and greyer than in
Decorated glass, but that the figures, and especially the canopies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
are for the first time, practically speaking, altogether in white,
only very slightly relieved with yellow stain. The student who
accepted this as typical Decorated work, would be quite at sea
when he came to Perpendicular glass, in which this paler colour,
this preponderance of white, and especially this framing of the
figures in white canopy work, is a most distinctive, if not the
most distinctive, feature. After all, the window is Perpendicular;
and, though the glass in it may have many characteristics of
Decorated work, it cannot well be said that the glass is Decorated,
true though it be that glass did, as a rule, follow rather in
the wake of architectural progress.</p>

<p>Many windows are almost equally difficult to classify. In the Decorated
glass at Wells there are both earlier and later features. The heads
glazed in pinkish glass, with eyes and beards leaded up in white, strike
an Early note, whilst the broadly treated bases or pedestals of certain
canopies in the Lady Chapel, one of which is here shown (the canopies
themselves are strictly Decorated), prelude the coming style.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 251px;">
<a id="Fig_137" name="Fig_137"></a>
<img src="images/fig_137.png" width="251" height="500" alt="Canopy, New College, Oxford." title="Canopy, New College, Oxford." />
</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">137. CANOPY, NEW COLLEGE, OXFORD.</span></p>

<p>These bases remind one of those in the ante-chapel at New College,
Oxford, dating from the last quarter of the fourteenth century, which,
though it is not difficult to trace in them the lingering influence of
Decorated tradition, must undoubtedly be put down as early examples of
the later style. In these fine windows (upon which the tourist turns his
back whilst he admires the poor attempt of Sir Joshua Reynolds in the
West window) there is not yet the accomplishment of full-fledged
Perpendicular work. The figures, though full of fine feeling, are not
well drawn, and the painting is not delicate; but the design of the
glass, its setting out, the balance and arrangement of colour, the tone
of the windows, and the breadth of effect, are admirable; and it is
precisely in these respects that it proclaims itself of the later school
of Gothic. Indeed, we may assume that it was in order <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a><br />
<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
to include such work as this that the line was drawn at the year 1380.
To class it with Decorated glass would have been too absurd. Compare the
New College canopy on <a href="#Fig_137">page 180</a> with the Decorated canopy on <a href="#Fig_107">page 155</a> and
the more orthodox Perpendicular canopies <a href="#Fig_138">below</a> and on <a href="#Fig_141">pages 185</a>, <a href="#Fig_233">340</a>,
and there is no possible hesitation as to which it most resembles. The
only thing in which it shows any leaning towards Decorated work is in
the very occasional introduction of pot-metal colour; and the main thing
in which it differs from later Perpendicular design is that its shafts
are round instead of square, and that it is more solidly built up,
larger, more nobly conceived.</p>

<p>A parallel French instance is at the S. Chapelle at Riom, in which
canopies, having at first sight all the appearance of typically Late
Gothic work, prove to have details which one would rather describe as
Decorated. The German canopy work at Shrewsbury (<a href="#Fig_139">pages 183</a>, <a href="#Fig_142">186</a>) is not
very far removed from Decorated. The later Perpendicular canopies run to
finikin pinnacles.</p>

<span class="caption">138. <span class="smcap">Typical Perpendicular Canopy.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The New College canopies have none of the brassy yellow
colour characteristic of Decorated work, but are absolutely
silvery in effect. The gradual dilution, as one may say, of the
deep, rich, Early colour is noticeable throughout the fourteenth
century. Towards its close the glass painter halts no longer
between two opinions, between light and colour. He has quite
made up his mind in favour of white glass. He has come pretty
generally to conceive his window as a field of white, into which
to introduce a certain amount of rich colour, not often a very
large amount. As a rule, perhaps not more than one-fourth
of the area of a fifteenth century window was colour; for, in
addition to the white of the canopy, there was commonly a fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
amount of white in the draperies, and the flesh was now always
represented by white. The typical Perpendicular window, then,
is filled with shrinework in white, enclosing figures, or figure
subjects, into which white enters largely (the flesh and some of
the drapery, often a good deal, is sure to be white), upon a
background of colour. Not much of this coloured background,
most often in blue or ruby, and sometimes deep in colour, was
ordinarily shown, so fully was the space occupied by figure
work. Sometimes there would be represented, behind the
figure, a screen of white, so that only the head and shoulders
would stand revealed against dark colour. Sometimes this
screen would be in colour, contrasting with the background,
richly diapered in imitation of damask (<a href="#Fig_234">page 342</a>). Sometimes
the background would be white, leaded perhaps in quarries;
but in any case the prevalent scheme of design was to frame up
pictures, more or less in colour, in architectural canopy work of
white and stain. Yellow stain, it should be said, was freely
used in connection with all this white; and its invariable association
therewith is one of the marked characteristics of Later
Gothic glass; but as a rule the yellow was not only delicate in
tint but delicately introduced, so that it did not much disturb
the effect of white. There were significant passages of yellow
in it, but the effect of the mass was cool and silvery.</p>

<p>In canopies yellow stain was used as gold might be in stonework,
which the canopies imitated; crockets and pinnacles
would be tipped with yellow, as with gilding (see <a href="#Fig_139">opposite</a>),
and the reveal of the arch, shown in false perspective above the
figure, would be similarly stained, so as to soften the transition
from the dark colour of the background to the white of the
canopy mass.</p>

<p>One comes upon windows, probably of about the beginning
of the end of the fourteenth century, in which the colour
scheme is practically limited to red, white, and blue, the yellow
being, comparatively speaking, lost in the white. Again, one
finds windows in which the colours are much lighter than in
earlier glass. But as a rule the lighter colours now introduced
(the glazier&#8217;s palette was by this time quite extensive) were used
to support, and not to the exclusion of, the richer and deeper
colour, which is the glory of glass, seldom to be dispensed with
even in grisaille. You may do without colour altogether, but
pale colours always have a poor effect.</p>

The typical Perpendicular canopies illustrated and already referred to
are quite favourable specimens of the kind of thing in vogue throughout
the fifteenth century. In France much the same forms were adopted (<a href="#Fig_234">page
342</a>). Some exceptionally delicate figure-and-canopy windows (or parts of
them) are to be found in the cathedral at Toulouse&mdash;the figure in
colour, or in white and colour, against a background of white, richly
diapered with damask pattern, which quite sufficiently distinguishes it
from the architecture only just touched with yellow. An instance of
later German work is given <a href="#Fig_140">below</a>. The German designer indulged
temperamentally in the interpenetration of shafting and other vagaries
of the kind, which we find in German stone carving. Sometimes in German
work, and occasionally also in French, Late Gothic canopies were all in
yellow, framing the picture, as it were, in gold. As a rule, however,
they were, as with us, silvery in tone, and framed the coloured glass in
a way most absolutely satisfactory, so far as effect is concerned.</p>

<p>In itself, however, this canopy work is rarely of any great
interest; occasionally, as already in the preceding century, the
designer has enniched in the shafts little figures of saints or
angels (there is just the indication of such introduction of little
statuettes in the very simple and restrained example of canopy
work from Cologne, on <a href="#Fig_147">page 191</a>), redeeming it from dulness;
but as a rule it is trite and commonplace to a degree. The
white, as frame, is perfect. It is none the more so that it
simulates misplaced stonework. What a strange thing it is in
the history of ornament that the natural bias of the designer
seems to be so irresistibly towards imitation! The man&#8217;s first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
thought seems to be to make the thing he is doing look like something it
is not. Why, having designed openings in the wall of his building, he
should proceed forthwith to fill them up with something in poor
imitation of masonry, is a mystery. Economy had then, perhaps, as now,
more to do with it than art, for it is a very cheap expedient.</p>

<p>Not only in the matter of colour, but in that of proportion, the later
Gothic canopies were a great improvement upon what had gone before. They
were distributed still very much upon the horizontal principle so
noticeable in Decorated work; but by this time the architect had come to
the tardy conclusion that the long lights of his window wanted holding
together, and he tied them together, if they were of any length, by
means of transoms, in which case the glass-worker had to deal with
lights of manageable length. The light from All Souls&#8217; College, <a href="#Fig_141">here
given</a>, is an example of a very usual Perpendicular arrangement. About
one half its entire length is occupied by a figure enshrined, as it
were, in an architectural niche. The base of the canopy is about equal
in height to the width of the light. The shafts are broad enough to
emphasise the independence of the light. The pinnacles of the canopy
extend into the window head. A point or two of background colour, as
though one could see through, are ingeniously introduced into the canopy
and its base. It would be difficult to better <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
such an arrangement of white and colour, except that one feels the
urgent want of a margin of white, to separate the coloured background
from the masonry round the window head.</p>

The idea is, no doubt, that the shrinework should appear to stand in the
opening, and the figure be sheltered under that. The illusion aimed at,
it is scarcely necessary to say, is not produced, and in any case would
not have been worth producing. On the contrary, the desirable thing to
be done was, to acknowledge the window opening, which, except for this
pretence, the colour of the design effectually does.</p>

<span class="caption">144. <span class="smcap">The Queen of Sheba before Solomon, Fairford.</span></span>
</div>

<p>A frequent and equally typical arrangement was, where the light was long
enough, to make the base itself take the form of a low canopy over a
more or less square-proportioned subject, possibly a scene in the life
of the Saint pourtrayed above. This gave opportunity of introducing
figures on two different scales, without in any way endangering the
significance of the more important figure, which, by its size and
breadth of colour, asserted itself at a distance from which the smaller
subject appeared only a mass of broken colour. The proportions and
outline of such a subject are indicated by the Nativity on <a href="#Fig_37">page 54</a>, the
jagged line at the top of the picture marking the inner line of the
canopy work. In German work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> very commonly the base canopy
encloses, as, for example, at Cologne Cathedral, a panel of heraldic
blazonry.</p>

<p>The height of the canopy was, with us, more or less in accordance with
the length of the window; but sometimes more space was allowed for the
figure than at All Souls&#8217;, and the vacant space about the head of the
saint was occupied with a label in white and stain bearing an
inscription. There are some admirable figure-and-canopy windows of this
description on the north side of the choir of York Minster, which seem
to have inspired a great deal of our modern mock-Perpendicular
figure-and-canopy glass. The label occurs, on a background of white
architecture, behind the Prophets from Fairford on <a href="#Fig_143">pages 187</a>, <a href="#Fig_253">391</a>. A
more important example of it occurs round the figure of Edward the
Confessor, from S. Mary&#8217;s, Ross (<a href="#Fig_145">opposite</a>), and again in the group from
the same source on <a href="#Fig_232">page 339</a>. Extremely clever ornamental use is made of
the label&mdash;a typically Perpendicular form of enrichment&mdash;in
the German glass on <a href="#Fig_142">page 186</a>. The extraordinary breadth of the
phylacteries held by the Prophets in the early fifteenth century windows
in the S. Chapelle at Riom, gives them quite a character of their own,
and an admirable one.</p>

<p>At Great Malvern we find the lights above the transom of a window
occupied each by a figure and its canopy, whilst <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a><br /><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
the lower lights contain each three tiers of small subjects, separated
only by bands of inscription. In the four-light window at Malvern
illustrating the Days of Creation, each light contains three little
subjects, one of which is given on <a href="#Fig_174">page 252</a>. Sometimes, as in the
windows from Fairford on <a href="#Fig_144">pages 188</a>, <a href="#Fig_248">372</a>, subjects under a canopy are
drawn to a scale as large as the size of the window will allow.</p>

<p>In some shape or another the canopy almost invariably appears in
connection with figure work; it is the rarest thing to find, in place of
the familiar shafting, a border, such as that <a href="#Fig_147">opposite</a>.</p>

<p>Of the gradual improvement in drawing in the fifteenth century work it
is not necessary to say much. It belongs to the period rather than to
glass painting, and it is shown in the examples illustrated. It is of no
particular country, though our English work was possibly more
constrained than contemporary continental work. Particularly
characteristic of English work was the delicate tracing of the faces,
which were pencilled, in fine lines, the treatment altogether rather
flat, and this at a period when foreign glass was much more solidly
modelled. It is not possible, on the scale of illustration determined by
a book of this size, to illustrate this English peculiarity as clearly
as one would wish, but it will be apparent to the seeing eye even here.
It is within the bounds of possibility that the Fairford glass may have
been executed in England; if so, Flemish or German painters certainly
had a hand in it. To compare it with the neighbouring Perpendicular
glass at Cirencester, with its delicate tracing and fine stain (in which
matter the Fairford glass does not by any means excel), is to see how
very different it is from typical English work. Whether we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
look at the detail of the canopies, or the drawing of the drapery, or
the painting of the glass, we see little to connect this with English
work, though it falls at once into its place as excellent Late Gothic
glass. In the windows of the nave of Cologne Cathedral, a figure from
one of which is <a href="#Fig_147">here given</a>, German Gothic glass reaches its limit. There
is already a trace, if only in the broad shaft of the canopy, of
Renaissance influence in the design. In others of these windows there
are no single figures. Entire lights are filled with biblical or
legendary scenes, one above the other, under dwarf canopies, which do
not very clearly define the horizontal divisions of the window; for all
that, the horizontal divisions are for the most part there. Except where
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
canopies are so insignificant as not to count, a Perpendicular window
presents, as a rule, a screen of silvery-white, on which the pictures
form so many panels of more or less jewelled colour.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 89px;">

<span class="caption">146. <span class="smcap">York Minster.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The enormous East window at York Minster, which belongs
to the very early years of the fifteenth century, contains, apart
from its tracery, no less than a hundred and seventeen subjects
in its twenty-seven lights; but the canopies dividing them are
so narrow that they scarcely answer the purpose of frames
to the separate subjects. The design is inextricably confused,
and the subjects are very difficult to read; but the effect is still
as of a mass of jewels caught in a network of white. In fact,
the progress towards light is such that, whereas in the last
century the problem was how to get more and more white glass
into a coloured window, it seems now more often to be how to
get colour into a white one.</p>

<p>White and stain enter so largely into Late Gothic glass that
there remains little to be said about grisaille. The glass of the
period is, for the most part, in grisaille and colour, the difference
between it and earlier grisaille being, that it consists so largely
of figure-and-canopy work. Windows, however, do occur all in
white or all in white and stain. Figures, for example, in white
and stain, occur, as in the South transept at York, on a ground
of delicately painted quarries. Again, a common arrangement
is that of figures in white and colour against a background
of quarry work, a band of inscription separating the pavement
upon which they stand from quarries below them. Such figures
form a belt across many moderate-sized windows in parish
churches. Mere quarry lights also occur, with a border in
which perhaps some colour occurs. But the subject of quarries
and quarry windows is reserved for consideration in a <a href="#Page_283">chapter</a>
by itself.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the drift of Later Gothic in the
direction of white glass was uninterrupted. That was by no
means so. At certain places, and at certain periods, and
especially by certain artists, there seems to have been a reaction
against this tendency, if ever there was any yielding to it. For
example, notwithstanding all that has been said about the
lighter tone of Decorated glass, some of the very finest fourteenth
century German work, at S. Sebald&#8217;s Church, Nuremberg,
is as intensely and beautifully rich as anything in Early work.
There rows of small subjects are framed in little canopies as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
deep in colour as the pictures, and white glass is conspicuous
by its absence. The nearest approach to it is an opaque-looking
horn colour, and that is used only very sparingly. Possibly,
however, it is not quite fair to call these windows rich, for the
upper part of them is light. So light is it, and so little has
it to do with the stained glass, that one scarcely accepts it as
part of the window, and therefore speaks of it as if it ended
with the colour.</p>

<p>The unfortunate plan has been adopted here, as in the
cathedral at Munich and elsewhere in Germany, of filling only
about half the window, from the sill upwards, with strong
stained glass. This ends abruptly at an arbitrary and very
unsatisfactory canopy arch, which, in a way, frames it; and
above it the window is filled with plain white rounds. At
Freiburg there is yet a further band of plain rounds next the
sill of the windows. The object of this is, doubtless, to get
light into the church; but the effect is as if the builders had
run short of coloured glass, and had only finished off the window
temporarily. As a means of combining white and colour this
German shift is not, of course, to be compared to the plan current
elsewhere of distributing them in alternating bands. It does not
attempt to combine them, but cuts the window deliberately in
two. Not until you have shaded off from your eyes the
distracting rays of white light, can you properly appreciate or
enjoy the coloured glass.</p>

<p>But, if these windows must be considered, as in a sense they
must be, as conforming to the demand for more light, there are
others in which strong colour is carried consistently through,
not only in the fourteenth but in the fifteenth century. (It
is irritating and annoying to have to hark back in this way
to periods supposed to have been long since left behind, but any
arbitrary line of division between the styles must, as it were,
cut off points which project from one into the other, sometimes
very far indeed across the boundary line; and hence
the absolute necessity, at times, of seeming to retrace our
steps, if we would really trace the progress of design.) There
are shown <a href="#Fig_148">opposite</a> four lights out of a large window in the
clerestory of the cathedral at Troyes, in which the history of
the Prodigal Son is pictured in little upright subjects, framed
in canopies of quite modest proportions and of colour which
in no wise keeps them separate from the richly coloured figures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a><br /><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>underneath. One of them, for example, is of green, very much
the colour of an emerald, on an inky-purple ground. The result
is a very rich window, full of quaintly dramatic interest when
you come to examine it; but there are no broadly marked
divisions of colour in the glass to affect the architecture of the
building one way or the other, nor does it tell its tale very
plainly. It is more easily read on <a href="#Page_194">page 194</a> than from the floor
of the church.</p>

<p>In the windows so far discussed the figure subjects, however
small and however close together, have always been marked off
one from the other, slightly as it might be, at first by the
marginal lines round the early subject medallions, and then by
canopies. It is shown in another fifteenth century window from
Troyes (<a href="#Fig_149">opposite</a>) how even that amount of framework was now
sometimes abandoned.</p>

<p>Progress in glass design, it was said, was in the direction of
light and of picture. Moved by the double impulse, the designer
of the Later Gothic period framed his coloured pictures in white.
But where he happened not to care so much about light, or had
not to consider it, he omitted even the narrow shaft of white or
colour (which, so long as he used a canopy, usually divided
the picture from the stonework) and left it to the mullions to
separate them vertically. Horizontally he divided them slightly
by a band of ornament, as at Troyes, of about the width of
the mullions, or more frequently, and more plainly, by lines
of inscription on white or yellow bands. If the subjects were
arranged across the window in tiers alternately on ruby and
blue grounds, that, of course, separated each somewhat from the
one next above and below it, but it banded those on the same
level together. This helped the architectural effect, but confused
the story-telling.</p>

<p>If the pictures were arranged, throughout the width as well as
the length of the window, alternately in panels on red and blue
grounds, that kept the pictures rather more apart, but made the
distribution of the colour all-overish. That mere change of
ground could not keep pictures effectively separate will be clear
when it is seen (<a href="#Fig_148">opposite</a>) how little of the background extends
to the mullion. The greater part of the figures come quite up
to the stonework, and the subjects consequently run together.
It is difficult to realise, except by experience, how little the
stonework can be depended upon to frame stained glass. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><br /><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>seems when you see it all upon paper that the mullions, with
their strongly marked mouldings, must effectually frame the
glass between them. They do nothing of the kind. They go
for so much shadow: what you see is the glass. This the glass
painters realised at length, and took to carrying their pictures
across them. And it has to be confessed that so long as they
schemed them cleverly the interference of the mullion was not
much felt.</p>

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">149. THE STORY OF TOBIT, TROYES.</span></p>

<p>The distinction drawn so far between &#8220;single figures&#8221; and
&#8220;subjects&#8221; has answered its obvious purpose; but that also is,
in a manner, arbitrary. Figures standing separately, each in a
light by itself, form very often a series&mdash;such as the four Evangelists,
the twelve Apostles, the Prophets, the Doctors of the
Church, or a succession of kings, bishops, or other ecclesiastics.
More than that, they form perhaps a group. When we discover
that facing the figure of the Virgin Mary is that of the
Angel Gabriel, we see at once that, though each figure occupies
a separate light of the window, and each stands in its own
separate niche, we have in reality here a subject extending
through two lights&mdash;the Annunciation. So in a four-light window&mdash;if
in one light stands the Virgin with the Infant Christ,
and in the others a series of richly garbed figures with crowns
and gifts in their hands, it is clear that this represents the
Adoration of the Magi&mdash;a subject in four lights; and the canopies
over them may be taken to be one canopy with four niches. A
yet more familiar instance of continuity between the single
figures in the lights of a window occurs where the central light
contains the Christ upon the cross, and in the sidelights stand
the Virgin and S. John. We have in such cases the beginning
of the subject extending through several lights. It is only a short
step from the Annunciation, or the Adoration, or the Crucifixion
described, to the same subject, under one canopy, extending
boldly across the window, with shafts only to frame the picture
at its sides. That is what was done&mdash;especially in Germany.
It occurs already in Early Decorated glass, where the upper
part of a big geometric window is sometimes occupied by
brassy pinnacle work, which asserts itself, perhaps, upon a
ground of mosaic diaper, in the most unpleasant way. In
the white glass of a later period the effect was happier.</p>

<p>At first the designer did not, as a rule, aspire to carry his
subjects right across a big window. Accepting the transom as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
a natural division, he would perhaps divide a four-light window
vertically into two, so as to get four subjects, each under a
canopy extending across two lights; or, in a five-light window,
he would probably separate these by other narrow subjects in
the central lights. Divisions of this kind often occur already in
the stonework of the window, the lights being architecturally
divided by stronger mullions into groups. In that case all the
glass painter does is to emphasise the grouping of the lights
schemed by the architect. Where the architect has not provided
for such grouping he does it, perhaps, for himself. It
enables him to design his figures on a larger scale, and to get
a much broader effect in his glass than he could do so long as
he kept each picture rigorously within the limits of a single
light. Consideration for his picture had probably more to do
with his reticence than respect for its architectural framework;
and so soon as ever he realised how little even a strong mullion
would really interfere with his work, he made no scruple to
take all the space he wanted for his purpose. Infinite variety
of composition is the result. The upper half of the window
is perhaps devoted to a single subject, or to two important
pictures, whilst below the transom the lights are broken up
into quite little pictures; or in place of these smaller pictures
may be found little panels of heraldry, as occurs often in
Flemish work. These or the smaller pictures may be continued
in the sidelights of a broad window, flanking, and in
a way framing, a large central picture. Sometimes, as in the
nave of Cologne Cathedral, the upper half of the window may
contain one imposing composition; below that may be a series
of important single figures, each provided with its separate
canopy; and below that again, at the base of the window, may
be a series, or several series, of small heraldic panels.</p>

<span class="caption">150. <span class="smcap">Fairford.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The canopy extending across a broad window (<a href="#Fig_151">page 200</a>) may
be so schemed that there is obvious recognition of the lights into
which it is divided, or it may sprawl across the window space
with as little regard to intervening mullions as possible. There
is now, in short, full scope for the fancy of the artist, were he
never so fanciful; and it would be a hopeless task to try and
catalogue the lines on which the design of a large window
might now be set out.</p>

<p>We do not in the fifteenth century arrive yet at the most
remarkable achievements in glass painting. But you have only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
to compare such pictures as those on <a href="#Fig_148">pages 194</a>, <a href="#Fig_149">196</a>, with that
on <a href="#Fig_71">page 127</a> to see what a complete revolution has come over
the spirit of design. It is not only that the draughtsman has
learnt to draw, and the painter to paint; they work on quite a
different system. It was explained (<a href="#Page_44">page 44</a>) how in early days
the glazier conceived his design as mosaic, how he first thought
it out in lead lines, and only relied on paint to help him out
in details which glazing could not give him. Now, it is easy
to see that the painter begins at the other end. He thinks
out his picture as a painting, and relies upon glazing only for
the colour which he cannot get without it.</p>

<p>In the beginning, it was said, the glazier might often have
fixed his lead lines, and trusted to his ingenuity to fill them in
with painted detail. Now, it would seem, the painter might
almost have sketched his picture, and then bethought him how
to glaze it. But that is not yet really so. He did not even
conceive his design as a picture and then translate it into
glass. His work runs so smoothly it cannot be translation.
The ingenuity with which he leads up little bits of colour
in the midst of white, is no mere feat of engineering; it is
spontaneous. It is clear that he had the thought of glazing
in his mind all along&mdash;that he designed for it, in fact. The
difference between the thirteenth century and the fifteenth
century designer is, that one thinks first of glazing, is primarily
a glazier, the other thinks first of painting, is primarily
a painter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<br />
SIXTEENTH CENTURY WINDOWS.</h3>

<p>The customary line between Gothic and Renaissance glass is
drawn at about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1530. That is to say, that there are to
be found examples, presumably of that date, which are still
undoubtedly Gothic in character. But he would be a bold man,
even for an arch√¶ologist, who dared to say precisely when the
Gothic era came to an end.</p>

<p>Quite early in the sixteenth century the new Italian movement
began to make itself felt in France, Germany, Flanders; in
due course it spread to this country. Eventually it supplanted
the older style; but it was only by degrees that it insinuated
itself into the affections of cis-alpine craftsmen. And in stained
glass, even more plainly than in wood or stone carving, is seen
how gradually the new style was assimilated by the medi√¶val
craftsmen&mdash;more quickly, of course, by the younger generation
than the older&mdash;so that, concurrently with design in the quasi-Italian
manner, Gothic work was still being done. Much of the
earlier Renaissance work shows lingering Gothic influence. In
the first quarter of the sixteenth century a great deal of glass was
designed and executed by men hesitating between the old love
and the new, only partially emancipated from medi√¶val tradition,
or only imperfectly versed in the foreign style.</p>

<p>There is a window at S. Nizier, at Troyes, for example, in
which the details are Renaissance, but the feeling is quite
Gothic. The subjects are even explained by elaborate yellow
scrolls or labels inscribed in black, very much after the manner
of those which form such a feature in the German Gothic
work at Shrewsbury (<a href="#Fig_142">page 186</a>). Renaissance forms are traced
with a hand which betrays long training in the more rigid
medi√¶val school; and Gothic and Italian details are put together
in the same composition with a <i>na√Øvet√©</i> which is sometimes
quite charming.</p>

<p>You can see that the designer of the window on <a href="#Fig_152">page
203</a> was not untouched by Renaissance influence.  Possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
he thought the hybrid ornament in his canopy was quite up
to date.</p>

<p>In the glass in the nave of Cologne Cathedral the suspicion
aroused by the side columns of the otherwise quite Gothic
canopy on <a href="#Fig_147">page 191</a> is confirmed by definitely Renaissance
forms in the ornament in the window head. Again, at the
Church of S. Peter, at Cologne, is a sort of pointed canopy
with ornament which looks at first like Gothic crockets, but
on nearer view it is just Italian arabesque in white and stain.
Apart from architectural accessories and detail of costume or
ornament, to justify the attribution of the work to this or
that period, it is very often difficult to give a name to early
Renaissance work; the only safe refuge is in the convenient
word transitional.</p>

<p>But for the nimbus in perspective, and the shield of arms and
its little amorino supporter, it would have seemed safe to describe
the &#8220;Charge to S. Peter&#8221; from S. Vincent at Rouen on <a href="#Fig_156">page 207</a>
as &#8220;Gothic.&#8221;</p>

<p>In French glass a lingering Gothic element is noticeable at a
period when Italian forms had firmly established themselves in
contemporary plastic art; but, then, glass painting was not an
Italian art; and, whilst wood carvers and sculptors were imported
from Italy, and directly influenced the Frenchmen working with
them, glass painting remained in the hands of native artists.</p>

<p>Before very long the Renaissance did, of course, assert itself,
in glass painting as in all art, and we arrive at windows
absolutely different from anything that was done in the Middle
Ages. The change was in some places much more rapid
than in others. Wherever there was a strong man his influence
would make for or against it. But meanwhile much
intermediate work was done, belonging more or less to the
new school, whilst retaining very much of the character of
Gothic glass.</p>

<p>That Gothic character was something well worth keeping; for
it is the character which belongs inherently to the material.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 449px;">
<a id="Fig_152" name="Fig_152"></a>

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">152. <span class="smcap">St. Mary&#8217;s, Shrewsbury.</span></span></p>

<p>The Gothic glass painters did, in fact, so thoroughly develop
the resources of the material, that a Renaissance window treated
really like glass inevitably suggests the lingering of Gothic
tradition. This is no slight praise of Gothic work; and, by
implication, it tells against the later Renaissance glass painters,
whose triumphs were in a direction somewhat apart from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
craft. The great windows at Brussels, for example (<a href="#Fig_42">page 71</a>),
illustrate a new departure. They seem to have nothing in
common with medi√¶val art. On the other hand, one traces
the descent of such masterpieces of translucent glass painting
as are to be found at Arezzo (<a href="#Fig_254">page 397</a>), through those same
intermediate efforts, directly to Gothic sources.</p>

<p>To trace the steps by which the new encroached upon the
old, as one may do, for example, at Rouen, is almost to
come to the conclusion that the short but brilliant period of
Renaissance glass painting is really the after-fruit of Gothic
tradition, fertilised only by the great flood of Renaissance feeling
which swept over sixteenth century art. Nowhere is this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
more clearly argued than in the windows at Auch, completed,
according to all accounts, as early as 1513. A strain of Gothic
is betrayed by the cusping which here and there fringes a
semicircular canopy arch; but no less mistakably medi√¶val is
the technique throughout, and equally so the setting out of the
windows. For the somewhat imposing canopies are not, for
once, devised as frames to correspondingly important pictures;
but are simply shrines adorned with figures each confined to its
separate light: it is only the small subsidiary predella or other
such pictures which extend beyond the mullions. No doubt
there is doctrinal intention in the juxtaposition of Prophets,
Sibyls, and the rest&mdash;one of whom may even be supposed to be
addressing the other&mdash;but to all intents and purposes decorative,
they are just a row of standing figures, as distinct
one from the other as the usual series of figures under quite
separate canopies. It is only the canopy which connects them.
This kind of composition (which is seen again at Troyes, <a href="#Fig_151">page
200</a>) would never have occurred to a man altogether cut off
from Gothic tradition.</p>

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">153. <span class="smcap">Chapel of the Bourbons, Lyons.</span></span></p>

<p>It is worth remarking that, even when Gothic and Renaissance canopies
alternate at Auch in a single window, or where Gothic niches are built,
as it were, into or on to larger Renaissance structures, there is no
appearance of incongruity. Truth to tell, the Gothic is not so purely
Gothic, nor the Renaissance so purely Renaissance, as that they should
clash one with the other. Both are seen through the temperament of the
artist. He mixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
them in his mind; and the result is quite one, <i>his</i> style in short.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 194px;">

<span class="caption">154. <span class="smcap">S. Godard, Rouen.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Early Renaissance glass submitted itself, one can hardly say
duly, but almost as readily as late Gothic design, to the restraint
of Gothic mullions. The windows in which, as it happens, some
of the best Early French Renaissance work is found (and it is
in France that the best is to be found) are often smaller than
the great Perpendicular windows referred to, and do not lend
themselves to such elaborate subdivision. But the lines on
which they are subdivided are very much as heretofore. The
canopy still extends through several lights, and covers a single
subject. Only now it is Renaissance in design. That does not
mean to say merely that round arched architecture takes the
place of pointed. The round arch occurs indeed, as in the
windows in the Chapel of the Bourbons, in Lyons Cathedral
(on <a href="#Fig_153">pages 204</a> and <a href="#Fig_239">349</a>), supplemented by amorini and festoons
of fruit. But more often the canopy takes the form of a frieze
of Renaissance ornament, painted in white and stain, as at
S. Godard, Rouen (<a href="#Fig_154">opposite</a>), or glazed in white on colour, as in
the cathedral of the same city (<a href="#Fig_45">pages 75</a>, <a href="#Fig_240">350</a>), supported at each
end by a pilaster. Not seldom it resolves itself into arabesque
only very remotely connected with architecture at all. Indeed,
if it simulate anything, it is goldsmith&#8217;s work rather than
masonry. Executed, as at Rouen (<a href="#Fig_45">pages 75</a>, <a href="#Fig_155">206</a>), in brilliant
yellow on a dark coloured ground, it has very much the appearance
and value of beaten gold. That, rather than sculpture,
must have been in the mind of the designer. One form of
imitation is not much better than another; but here, at all
events, there is nothing which in the least competes with the
surrounding architecture; and it will scarcely be denied by
any one who takes the least interest in ornament, that design of
this kind is vastly more amusing than the dull array of misplaced
pinnacles which often did duty for ornamental detail in Gothic
shrinework. A German version of a canopy which ceases
almost to be a canopy and becomes more like arabesque, is
given on <a href="#Fig_240">page 350</a>. That is supported by columns (the caps are
shown in the illustration) rather out of keeping with the ornament
they support, which makes very little pretence of being
architectural. The canopies on <a href="#Fig_153">pages 204</a>, <a href="#Fig_240">350</a>, are supported
only on little brackets at each side, and have no shafts at all.
This marks a new departure. The picture has now no frame
at its sides, only the stone mullion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 395px;">
<a id="Fig_155" name="Fig_155"></a>

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">155. <span class="smcap">S. Patrice, Rouen.</span></span></p>

<p>It was explained, in reference to glazing, what confusion of
detail resulted from the use of leads of which some were intended
to form part of the design and some not. Similar confusion is
inevitable when certain of the mullions are meant to be accepted
as frame to the picture and others to be ignored. The perhaps
not very conspicuous canopy is often the only hint as to which
of the stone divisions you are to accept as such, and which not.
Even that was not always there to serve as a guide. Already,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a><br /><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>as early as 1525, the date given to the window illustrating the
life of S. Peter (<a href="#Fig_156">page 207</a>), the canopy was sometimes annulled,
and the window given over entirely to picture, either one
complete subject or a series of smaller ones. The window
dedicated to S. Peter contains in its four lights eight equal
subjects, a plan adopted in several others of the windows at
S. Vincent, Rouen. In a series of unframed subjects, such as
these, there is much less danger of confusion should some one
prominent figure recur throughout always in the same costume.
That is the case here, and again at Ch√¢lons, where the figure of
Our Lord, robed in purple, is conspicuous throughout: the mind
grasps at a glance that this is not one picture but a series.</p>

<p>A change of period is indicated by the departure from the disc-shaped
nimbus. On <a href="#Fig_156">pages 207</a>, <a href="#Fig_157">210</a>, <a href="#Fig_170">234</a>, <a href="#Fig_254">397</a>, the nimbus is
shown in perspective; an attempt is even made to make it
hover above the head, an effect not possible to produce in leaded
glass; even at Arezzo it is not achieved. Neither is the use of
a mere ring of light, whether in flat or in perspective, a happy
substitution for the Gothic colour disc, as may be seen, for
example, at Cologne. The idea of the nimbus only keeps within
the border line which separates the sublime from the ridiculous,
so long as the thing is frankly accepted as a symbol, not as
an effect. But, were it otherwise, the use of the strongly
marked disc of colour about the head of prominent personages
has an enormous value as a means of distinguishing them from
the background or from surrounding figures. Its decorative
importance is no less than its symbolic. Very especially is this
so in glass; and the glass painter who wantonly departs from
its use, reduces it to a mere ring (which does not separate it at
all from the background) or poises it in the air, is beginning to
wander from the way, narrow if you please, which leads to
success in glass. This is said with some reluctance in face
of the all but perfect little panel from S. Bonnet, at Bourges,
on <a href="#Fig_157">page 210</a>. It is true that there the nimbus of the boy saint,
though in perspective, does by its dark tone separate the
head from the light ground, as the face is separated from
the darker drapery of his teacher; and, in so far, little of
definition is sacrificed; but, after all, admirably as the design
is schemed, the oval nimbus is not a whit less conventional
than the round disc of medi√¶val times, and it does lack
something of distinction and dignity which that conveyed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
The date inscribed (1544) serves to remind us that we are
nearing the middle of the century, at which period glass
painting may safely be said to have reached its zenith and
to be nearing the verge of decline.</p>

<p>It will have been seen in the examples lately instanced how
story is gradually more and more naturally set forth in glass.
There is now no vestige of flat treatment left. Even the
standing figure (<a href="#Fig_147">page 191</a>) stands forth from his niche, and
though he may be backed by a curtain of damask, there is
shown above that a background of receding architecture. So in
the S. Bernard windows at Shrewsbury (<a href="#Fig_38">pages 56</a>, <a href="#Fig_152">203</a>) there is
architectural distance shown in perspective, and again in the
subjects from Fairford, whether it be the portcullised gate of
Jerusalem that is represented (<a href="#Fig_173">page 251</a>), or the very inadequate
palace of King Solomon (<a href="#Fig_144">page 188</a>), or the Garden of Eden, in
which the scene of the Temptation is primitively pourtrayed
(<a href="#Fig_248">page 372</a>), there is some attempt to render the scene. Even
in the fifteenth century work at Troyes (<a href="#Fig_148">page 194</a>) the Prodigal
is not merely shown among the swine, joining them in a dinner
of gigantic acorns, but he leans against an oak tree, and in
the distance is a little forest of trees. In Renaissance glass
the scene is much more naturally rendered, and forms almost
invariably an important part of the composition. Witness the
palace of Herod (<a href="#Fig_44">page 74</a>) when Salome dances before him,
which is a great advance upon the Gothic throne-room of King
Solomon (<a href="#Fig_144">page 188</a>).</p>

<p>The scene takes one of three forms: either it is architectural,
or it is landscape, or it is of architecture and landscape
combined. A very favourite plan of the French was to show
distant architecture (glazed in deep purple) through which were
seen glimpses of grey sky, and perhaps a peep of landscape;
and it resulted invariably in a beautiful effect of colour. In fact,
a scheme of colour which recurs again and again at Rouen,
and in other French glass of the first part of the sixteenth
century, consists in the introduction of figures in rich colour
and white upon a background where white, green, purple, and
pale blue predominate to such an extent as to give quite a
distinctive character to the glass. The more distant landscape
was painted very delicately upon the pale grey-blue glass which
served for sky, as shown on <a href="#Fig_175">page 255</a>, and in the same way
architecture was also painted upon it. In the view through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a><br /><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>the arches above the screen in a window at Montmorency
(<a href="#Fig_158">page 213</a>), both trees and buildings are represented in that way
upon pale grey glass, the green of the trees and hills stained
upon it. Sometimes the distance is painted upon white, as at
King&#8217;s College, Cambridge; but in France the pale grey-blue
background is so usual as to be quite characteristic of the period.
All this is a long way from the mere diaper of clouds which in
the early fifteenth century sometimes took the place of damask
pattern upon the blue which formed a background to the Crucifixion,
or other scene out of doors. It is now no longer a case
of symbolising, but of representing, the sky, and it is wonderful
what atmospheric quality is obtained by the judicious use of
pale blue painted with the requisite delicacy. The beauty of
this kind of work, especially on a small scale, is beyond dispute.
Together with the rendering of the flesh, it implies consummate
skill in painting. The painter comes quite to the front; but he
justifies himself inasmuch as he is able to hold the place. He
does what his Gothic predecessors could not have done, and
does it perfectly. Could the Gothic artist have painted like
this, he also might have been tempted so far in the pictorial
direction as to have sacrificed some of the sterner qualities of
his design.</p>

<p>The architectural environment of the figures on <a href="#Fig_158">page 213</a>
fulfils somewhat the function of the Perpendicular canopy; it
forms a kind of setting of white for the colour; but, in the first
place, it does not pretend to frame them at the side, and, in
the second, the attempt at actual perspective necessitates an
amount of shading upon the white glass which detracts at once
from its purity and from its value as setting to the colour.
The idea is there that you see through the window into space;
and, though that effect is never obtained, it is wonderful how
far some of the glass painters later in the century went towards
illusion. A certain false air of truth was sometimes given to
the would-be deception by an acknowledgment of the window-shape&mdash;that
is, by making the foremost arch or arches follow the
shape of the window head, and form, as it were, a canopy losing
itself in perspective. Architecture proper to the subject, or
not too inappropriate to it, is sometimes schemed so far to
accommodate itself to the window-shape as to form, with the
white pavement, a more or less canopy-like setting for the
figures. It may be a sort of proscenium, the sides of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
recede into the picture, and form what may be called the
scenery. At King&#8217;s College, Cambridge, Esau is seen bargaining
away his birthright at a table where stands the coveted
pottage, in the midst of spacious halls going back into distant
vistas, seen through a sort of canopy next the actual stonework.
That concession to the framework of the window does mend
matters somewhat. The base of the picture <a href="#Fig_158">opposite</a>, for
example, is much more satisfactory than it would have been
had it not acknowledged the window-sill; but the architecture in
the top part of the lights is not a frame to the picture at all, nor
yet a finish to the glass: it is part of the picture, which thus,
you may say, occupies the window as a picture its canvas. In
reality that is not quite so. There is some acknowledgment,
though inadequate, of the spring of the arch by a horizontal
cornice parallel with the bar; and the arcading, though interrupted
by the mullion and by the marble columns, steadies
the design; and altogether the architecture is planned with
ingenuity, though without frank enough acceptance of the
window-shape. One would be more tolerant to such misguided
freedom of design were it not for the kind of thing it led to.
It must be admitted that both French and Flemings, until
they began to force their perspective, and to paint shadow
heavily, did very beautiful and effective work in this way.</p>

<p>A multitude of figures, as, for example, in the Judgment
of Solomon at S. Gervais, Paris, more or less in rich colour,
could be held together by distant architecture and foreground
pavement largely consisting of white glass, in a way which left
little to be desired, except fuller acknowledgment of the stonework.
But it took a master of design to do it, and one with
a fine sense of breadth and architectural fitness.</p>

<p>When such architecture was kept so light as to have the
full value of white, and when the figures against it were also
to a large extent in white, and the colour was introduced only
in little patches and jewels skilfully designed to form, here the
sleeves of a white-robed figure, there a headdress, there again
the glimpse of an underskirt, and so on&mdash;all ingeniously designed
for the express purpose of introducing rich colour, the whole
shot through with golden stain&mdash;the effect is sometimes very
beautiful.</p>

<p>Admirable Flemish work, Renaissance in detail, but carrying
on the traditions of Gothic art, is to be found in plenty at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a><br /><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>Li√®ge, both in the cathedral (1530 to 1557) and at S. Martin.
This is excellent in drawing and composition, most highly
finished in painting, fine in colour, and silvery as to its white
glass, which last is splendidly stained. In the same city there
is beautiful work also at S. Jacques, with admirable treatment
of the canopy on a large scale. It differs from French work
inasmuch as it is Flemish, just as the glass at the church
of Brou differs in that there is a characteristic Burgundian
flavour about it; but those are details of locality, which do
not especially affect the course of glass painting, and which
it would be out of place here to discuss.</p>

<p>In England we are not rich in Renaissance glass. The best
we have is Flemish, from Herkenrode, now in the cathedral at
Lichfield. The greater part of this is collected in seven
windows of the Lady Chapel&mdash;no need to explain which; the
miserable shields of arms in the remaining two convict themselves
of modernity. In the tracery, too, there is some old
glass, but it is lost in the glare of new glazing adjacent.
Otherwise this glass is not much hurt by restoration. Four
of the windows are treated much alike; that is, they have
each three subjects, extending each across the three lights
of which they are composed, some with enclosing canopy, and
some without. A fifth three-light window is broken up into
six tiers of subjects, each of which appears at first sight as if it
were confined to the limits of a single light, but there is in
fact connection between the figures; for example, of three
figures the central one proves to be the Patron Saint of the
Donor, himself occupying one of the sidelights, and his wife
the other. If the Saint is seated the Donors stand. If he
is represented standing they kneel before him. The two larger
six-light windows at Lichfield are divided each into four; that
is to say, the four quarters of the window have each a separate
subject which extends laterally through three lights, and in
depth occupies with its canopy about half the entire height of
the window.</p>

<p>The Lichfield glass has very much the character of that
at Li√®ge. So has the Flemish glass now at the east end of
S. George&#8217;s, Hanover Square, a church famous for its fashionable
weddings. This is some of the best glass in London, well
worthy the attention of the guests pending the arrival of
the bride. The design, however, is calculated to mystify the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
student, until he becomes aware that the lights form part of a
&#8220;Tree of Jesse,&#8221; adapted, not very intelligently, to their present
position, and marred by hideous restoration, such as the patch
of excruciating blue in the robe of the Virgin. The vine,
executed in stain upon white, with grapes in pot-metal purples,
is not nearly strong enough to support the figures; this may
be in part due to the decay of the paint, which has proceeded
apace.</p>

<p>Again, at Chantilly (<a href="#Fig_160">page 218</a>) may be seen how lead lines
quarrel with delicate painting. The more delicate the painting,
the greater the danger of that&mdash;a danger seldom altogether
overcome.</p>

<p>The most important series of Renaissance windows in this
country is in King&#8217;s College Chapel, Cambridge. &#8220;Indentures&#8221;
still remain to tell us that these were contracted for in 1516
and 1526. Apart from some strikingly English-looking figures
in white and stain upon quarry backgrounds in a side chapel,
and other remains of similar character, and from a very
beautiful window almost opposite the door by which one enters&mdash;differing
in type, in scale, in colour, altogether from the other
windows&mdash;the glass throughout the huge chapel was obviously
planned at the time of the first contract, and there is a certain
symmetry of arrangement throughout which bespeaks the
period of transition. The windows consist each of two tiers
of five lights. A five-light window offers some difficulty to the
designer if he desire (as in the sixteenth century he naturally
did) to introduce subjects extending across more than one
light. A subject in two lights does not symmetrically balance
with a subject in three. He might carry his subject right
across the window, but that might give him very likely a
larger space to fill than he wanted; and besides, the time was
hardly come for him to think of that. He might carry it across
the central group of three; but that would leave him a single
light on each side to dispose of. Remains the idea of a subject
in two lights at each side of the window, and a central
composition occupying only one light. That was not a very
usual plan, although it was adopted, at Fairford for example,
where the side subjects in two lights under a canopy are
effectually separated by a central subject which has none. At
King&#8217;s the sidelights have no canopies further than such as may
be accepted as part of the architecture proper to the subject,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a><br /><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>schemed more or less to frame the picture (as in the case of the
window at Montmorency, <a href="#Fig_158">page 213</a>); it is only in the centre
lights that the figures (two in each light, one above the other)
are enclosed in canopy work. These figures (described as
&#8220;messengers&#8221;), with elaborately flowing scrolls about them
inscribed with texts of Scripture, are many of them quite
Gothic in character, even though they have Renaissance
canopies over them. The designs of these mostly do duty
many times over, as if this merely decorative or descriptive
work were not of much account; and the same figure occurs,
here well painted, there ill done, or painted perhaps in a
late, loose way, quite out of keeping with the drawing: there
is no sort of sequence in them. The notion of these intermediate
figures, at once distinguishing the subjects one from
the other, and throwing light upon their meaning, is good.
But in effect it fails of its object, thanks to the independent
spirit of the later painters, who thought more of their pictures
than of architectural restraint.</p>

<small>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Photo-Tint</span>&#8221; by James Akerman, London, W. C.</small></span></p>

<p>The subjects on each side of the window are very large
in scale, very pictorially and very freely treated, very finely
designed at times, and very splendid in effect; but they are
most unequal, and they are all more or less of a tangle. Their
confusion is the greater inasmuch as there is no attempt to
balance one picture with another. A landscape background
on one side of the window answers to an architectural background
on the other. On one side the interest of the subject
is towards the top of the lights, on the other to the bottom,
and so on. Either subject or both may be so merged with the
&#8220;messengers&#8221; that a casual observer would hardly be aware of
the existence of such personages.</p>

<p>All this makes it difficult to trace the subject; and yet the
windows are in a certain pictorial way the more effective. In
fact the unity of the <i>window</i> has been preserved: the white
landscape on one side, and the white architecture on the other,
make equally a setting for the colour, and form, with the
&#8220;messengers&#8221; and their little canopies, <i>one</i> framing, not several
frames. Right or wrong, the artist has done what he meant
to do, and done it oftentimes very cleverly, though not with
uniform success. The inequality spoken of is not only in workmanship
but in design. Some of these pictures have characteristics,
such as the needless evasion of leading, which one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><br />
<a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
associates rather with quite the end of the century than with
anything like the date of the second contract: possibly the
execution of the work extended over a longer period of time
than is generally supposed. However that may be, the windows
generally, remarkable as they are, are not markedly enough of
a period to serve as an object lesson in glass design. They are
neither quite late enough to illustrate the decline of art, nor
workmanlike enough to show the culmination of sixteenth
century design&mdash;painter-like and pictorial, but in which the
designer knew how to make the most of the glass in which it
was to be wrought.</p>

<p>That is best seen in some of the French and Flemish work
above referred to, in the work, for example, at Ecouen and
Montmorency, so fully illustrated in Monsieur Magne&#8217;s most
admirable monograph. The figure, for example, of William
of Montmorency (<a href="#Fig_40">page 66</a>), the father of the great Anne, might
serve for a votive picture of the period; but it is designed,
nevertheless, as only a man careful of the conditions under
which glass painting was done could design. Careful of conditions!
That is just what the designers of the King&#8217;s College
glass were not, or not enough. And so begins the end.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<br />
LATER RENAISSANCE WINDOWS.</h3>

<p>The magnificent windows of Van Orley at S. Gudule, Brussels,
mark in a sense the summit of design, as well as of painting,
in stained glass. But it is design of a kind not strictly proper
to the material, for which reason the discussion of his work,
though it was done well within the first half of the sixteenth
century, has been reserved by way of introduction to the period
which it inaugurated, the period when the glass painter not
merely put painting first of all, but sacrificed to it qualities
peculiar to glass.</p>

<p>The heavy painting of this work and much that followed
it has already been discussed. But something of that was
perhaps implied in the very ideal of the painter; the execution
only follows out the scheme of the design. The scope as well
as the power of the designer is better illustrated in the two
great transept windows, than in those of the chapel of the
Holy Sacrament. Even in the very inadequate rendering of
the one of them on <a href="#Fig_42">page 71</a> may be seen how large and dignified
the man&#8217;s conception was. The effect is gorgeous; but it
is produced as simply, for all the unsurpassed elaboration of
ornamental detail, as a Goth could wish. An unsophisticated
designer of the thirteenth century could scarcely have gone more
directly to work. He would not have grouped his figures with
such art, but he would have separated each from the other and
from the ground in much such a straightforward way. Yet the
<i>motif</i> of the design, the idea of making figures and architecture
stand as it were in strong and round relief against the light,
went far to bring about excessive use of paint; and the design
is therefore in a measure at fault, as was the later Netherlandish
work, founded upon it, of which it may be taken as
the nobler type.</p>

<p>It is a far cry from the slender Perpendicular canopy to this
triumphal arch. The architecture is here no frame to the
picture, but the backbone of the picture itself, and it is disposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
in the most masterly way. It takes the place of a magnificent
high altar. Sometimes in compositions of this kind the altar-like
canopy enshrines a rich picture, just as veritable stonework
might frame a painted altar-piece, whilst in the foreground kneel
the Donors. In this case Charles the Fifth and his wife Isabella
and their attendant saints are the picture, the object of their
adoration, the Almighty, being relegated to one of the side
arches. Similarly in a three-light window (of much more
glassy character, however) at Montmorency, Guy de Laval has
the central position, and the crucifix before which he kneels
is put on one side. This is rather characteristic of the period.
In the sixteenth century windows were erected, not so much
to the glory of God, as to the glorification of the Donor, who
claimed a foremost, if not the very central, place for himself.</p>

<p>The donor was no doubt always, as to this day, an important
person in connection with the putting up of a stained glass
window. But in early days he was content to efface himself,
or if he appeared upon the scene at all it was in miniature,
modestly presenting the little image of his gift in a lower
corner of the window. In the fourteenth century he is still
content with the space of a small panel, bearing his effigy or his
arms, at the base of the window. Even in the fifteenth he is
content at times to be represented by his patron saint, as in the
beautiful window in the chapel of Jacques C&#339;ur, at Bourges.
In the sixteenth he is very much in evidence. No scruple
of modesty, or suspicion of unworthiness, restrains him from
putting in an appearance in the midst of the most serious and
sacred scenes, very much sometimes to the confusion of the
story. Eventually the donor, his wife, and perhaps his family,
with their patron saints, who literally back them up in their
obtrusiveness, claim, if they do not absorb, all our attention,
and the sacred subject takes quite a back place. In the foreground
of the scene of the Last Judgment which occupies the
great west window at S. Gudule, Brussels, kneels the donor,
with attendant angels, on a scale much larger than the rest of
the world, competing in fact in importance with the figure of Our
Lord in Majesty above.</p>

<p>However, the vain-glory of princes and seigneurs resulted
in the production of works of such consummate art that, as
artists, we can but be grateful to them. In the presence of the
splendid achievement of Van Orley, who shall say that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
artist does not justify himself? Nothing equal to it <i>in its way</i>
was ever done.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 191px;">
<a id="Fig_161" name="Fig_161"></a>

<span class="caption">161. <span class="smcap">The Parable of the Pharisee and the Publican, Gouda.</span></span>
</div>

<p>It may not be according to the strict rules of the game: it is not; but
that it is magnificent, no fair-minded artist can deny. Our just cause
of quarrel is, not with that, but with what that led to, what that
became in less competent hands. It is the price we pay for strong men
that they induce weak ones to follow them in a direction where they are
bound to fail. Van Orley&#8217;s triumphant answer to any carping of ours
would be, to point to the great west window of the cathedral, designed
on earlier and more orthodox lines,and say: &#8220;Compare!&#8221; We have no right
to limit art to what small folk can do.</p>

<p>The further development of the Netherlandish canopy is shown in the
Gouda glass <a href="#Fig_161">above</a>. Here is still considerable skill in the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
in which the window is set out, and the patches of colour are introduced
(for example, in the two figures leaning on the balcony and the wreath
of leaves and fruit above them) amidst the predominant white,&mdash;if
only the white glass had been whiter in effect. But there is altogether
too much of this architectural work, even though it is used, in the
pictured parable at least, to dramatic purpose. The notion of the
Pharisee gesticulating away in the far distance, whilst the Publican
modestly fills the foreground, is cleverly conceived and skilfully
carried out; but the picture is overpowered by its ponderous frame.</p>

<p>It is in the wonderful series of late sixteenth century windows at
Gouda, in Holland, that the fullest and furthest development of
pictorial design is shown. The period of their execution extends from
1555 to 1603; and, as they are admittedly the finest works of their day,
they may be taken to represent the best work of the latter half of the
sixteenth century. They are, in fact, typical of the period, only at its
best; it is not often that work of that date was designed with such
power or painted with such skill. The diagrams given <a href="#Fig_162">here</a> and on <a href="#Fig_46">pages
79</a>, <a href="#Fig_172">244</a>, <a href="#Fig_176">258</a>, do no manner of justice to the glass; but they will help
the reader better to understand what is said concerning it. They
indicate at least the lines on which these daring designers planned
their huge windows, the main lines which pictorial design on a large
scale is destined henceforth to take.</p>

<p>In the clerestory of S. Eustache, Paris, are some large
two-light windows which somewhat recall the Gouda work;
but the design is rather original. One vast architectural composition
in white, not very heavily painted, fills the window,
against which stand a series of giant Apostles in colour, one
in each light, occupying about one-third of the height of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
window. This much recognition of the separate openings is something to
be thankful for towards the middle of the seventeenth century.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 120px;">

<span class="caption">163. <span class="smcap">S. Sebald&#8217;s, Nuremberg.</span></span>
</div>

<p>A striking feature, we have seen, about the later Renaissance canopy as
shown at Gouda, and already at Brussels, is its vast dimensions. It no
longer frames the picture: it is a prominent, sometimes the most
prominent, feature in its design.</p>

<p>Even earlier than that the canopy was already sometimes of very
considerable extent. At S. Sebald&#8217;s, Nuremberg, there is a great
altar-like canopy ending in a pediment about two-thirds of the way up
the window, with plain white glass above, in which the shafting at the
side takes up practically the entire width of the two outer lights, as
here shown in the diagram of a portion of the glass. Yet this window is
as early as the year 1515, and before the period when masses of deep
shadow were represented by paint. Accordingly the canopy in this
instance is glazed in pot-metal of steely grey-blue, which, with the
little figures, mainly in steely grey armour against a white ground, and
the heraldic shields at the side, mainly in red and white, all very
slightly shaded, has a singularly fresh, bright, and delicate effect.</p>

<p>Another instance of preponderating architectural work occurs
also at Nuremberg in the choir of the church of S. Lorenz, and
though it belongs to the beginning of the seventeenth century,
that too is leaded up much as it might have been in the fifteenth.
But the great clumsy column, <a href="#Fig_164">opposite</a>, with its clumsier figure
of Fame, against a ruby background extending right up to the
stonework of the window, is not a satisfactory filling to the
outer light of a big window.</p>

<p>The last thing to expect of late Renaissance work is modesty
in the use of architectural accessories, whether in the form of
frame or background. Frame and background they are not;
they claim to be all or nothing. Just as ornamental design was
gradually pushed out of use by figure work, so the picture was in
time overpowered by its frame. And the frame was in the end
such that, when it came to be discarded, it was not much loss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">164. <span class="smcap">S. Lorenz, Nuremberg.</span></span>
</div>

<p>In the latter half of the sixteenth century and thenceforward design
continued to travel in the direction of what was meant for a sort of
realism. If the more or less altar-like canopy was retained, it was
meant to appear as if it stood bodily under the arch of the window; if
it was abandoned, you were supposed to see more or less <i>through</i> the
window, perhaps into distant country, perhaps into receding aisles of
the church.</p>

<p>It formed part of the canopy scheme, that the structure should end
before it reached the top of the window, so that you could see beyond it
into space. The designers would have been only too happy if they could
have done away with the glass above that. If they had had big sheets of
plate glass, they would certainly have used them to produce the effect
of out of doors&mdash;there was already a <i>plein air</i> school in the
eighteenth century&mdash;as they had not, they were obliged to accept
the inevitable, and lead up their white glass; but they went as far as
they could to doing away with its effect, using thin, transparent
material, which was not meant to appear as though it formed part of the
composition. Occasionally they would use pale blue glass, or tint it in
a blue enamel, further to suggest the sky beyond. This (<a href="#Fig_161">page 222</a>) would
commonly be glazed in squares. The pure white glass also was often
glazed in square or, as at Brussels, diamond quarries (<a href="#Fig_42">page 71</a>).</p>

<p>Subjects themselves, it has been explained, came to be glazed as much as
possible in rectangular panes; but it marks, it may here be mentioned, a
decline of design, as well as of technique, when these came to interfere
in any way, as they did, with the drawing. Having made up his mind that
his design is to be glazed in rigid square lines, the artist should
logically have designed accordingly. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> only to mark off
the glazing lines on his cartoon, and scheme his composition so that it
was not hurt by them. Towards the seventeenth century the plain glass,
the extra part beyond the canopy or beyond the picture, would often be
glazed in some simple pattern. That, you might imagine, stood for the
window <i>behind</i> the picture or the monument. At the church of S.
Jacques, Antwerp, above a picture of the Circumcision, is a canopy
leaded in squares and painted to look like falsehood, beyond which clear
glass is glazed in a pattern.</p>

<p>Occasionally an attempt is made to merge the picture into
the plain glazing above, as at S. Paul&#8217;s, Antwerp, where the
yellow sky, against which is shown the distant city, and so
on, is glazed in squares, which further off become gradually
white, and then at their interstices have smaller diamond-shaped
pieces of glass let in.</p>

<p>Where a subject glazed in quarries is represented against
a background of plain glazing of more elaborate design, there
is difficulty in joining the two, except by means of a strong
lead outline to the figures, or whatever may come next to the
plain glass, which outline the seventeenth century designer was
anxious before all things to avoid. Accordingly, as the plain
pattern work approached the margin of the painted work,
he replaced the leads by paint, which sham leads, of course,
could be made to disappear as seemed good to him. But
these little games of his, to judge by results, were hardly
worth the candle.</p>

<p>It will be seen how, in the French glass on <a href="#Fig_151">page 200</a>, the
canopy came to be backed and surrounded by unpainted glass,
quarries in that case. There the canopy sufficiently occupies
the window space not to strike one unpleasantly; but that
is sixteenth century work; later, and especially in Flanders,
canopies are represented, as in the cathedral at Antwerp (1615),
adrift, as it were, in a sea of plain glazing. Even when the
glass has some quality of glass the effect of that is not happy.
When the glass is thin and transparent it is disastrous.</p>

<p>At S. Jacques, Antwerp, again, coats of arms hover unsupported
in mid-air, the mere lines of the glazing being quite
inadequate to their apparent support. It is different, of course,
where the heraldic device, as <a href="#Fig_165">opposite</a>, is itself little more than
plain glazing. That is a very mild form of art; but, in its way,
it is satisfactory enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
Perhaps least fortunate of all in effect are the landscapes at
S. Jacques, which float, without even a canopy to frame them,
in an atmosphere of leaded glass. Antwerp is rich in glass,
much of it very cleverly executed, which would serve very well
to illustrate how <i>not</i> to design a window.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 392px;">

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">165. <span class="smcap">Gouda, 1688.</span></span></p>

<p>The place of the canopy was supplied sometimes, especially
in later Netherlandish work, by the cartouche so dear to the
Dutch. It fulfilled very much the office of the canopy, framing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
the design; and, had it been kept white, it would have framed it well,
affording circular and other shapes which form a welcome variation upon
the usual arched opening. But it was not white at all; very much the
reverse. Indeed the idea of the Dutch cartouche, with its
interpenetration of parts, and curling and projecting straps and bolts,
tempts the painter to a heavy method of painting, destructive of the
very quality of white. The device depends for its effect far too much
upon force of shadow to be of any great use in white glass. The
comparatively early cartouche in the lower half of the window at Gouda,
given on <a href="#Page_223">page 223</a>, is of the simplest kind, and has none of that
too-seductive bolt work; but it is dull and heavy in effect, being
painted in heavy brown, with the idea of giving atmospheric effect to
the picture supposed to be seen through it.</p>

<span class="caption">166. <span class="smcap">Plain Glazing, S. Gervais, Paris</span></span>
</div>

<p>A great cartouche is often used as a kind of base to a
canopy extending across the whole width of a wide window,
or the base of the canopy may include a very important
cartouche, occupied in either case by a long inscription. Here
again the oblong patch of white or yellow may have value,
in proportion as it is allowed to preserve the quality of glass.
There is, however, something poor and mean about large areas
of small lettering, and it is a pity to see the opportunity which
bold inscriptions give quite thrown away. Moreover, the
inscriptions are invariably too long. The framers of inscriptions
do not realise the multitude of readers they scare away
by the volume of their wording. The design of a window at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
S. Jacques, Antwerp, consists merely of an inscription label,
with a helmet above and mantling in black and white (the
black, of course, paint) set in plain glazing.</p>

<p>Up to the very last whole windows were glazed very often
in plain patterns, usually all in clear white glass. A couple of
designs, into which a little colour is introduced, are given <a href="#Fig_167">below</a>
and <a href="#Fig_166">opposite</a>. In spite of the increased facility for cutting glass,
afforded from the beginning of the century by the use of the
diamond, patterns were seldom very elaborate; but, by way
of illustrating what can be done by means of the diamond,
there is shown <a href="#Fig_168">overleaf</a> quite a conjuring feat of glazing.
The thick black lines in the drawing represent the leads; the
white spaces enclosed are plain white glass, rather poor in
quality; the thinner lines stand for cracks, possibly not, or
not all of them, of the glazier&#8217;s doing, for it would be almost
impossible to handle such work without breaking it. It is
well-nigh incredible that each of these <i>fleurs-de-lys</i> should have
been cut out of a single piece of glass, the marginal band to it
out of a second, and so with the background spaces. Glaziers
may be inclined to question the possibility of such a <i>tour de
force</i>, even in poor thin glass. Certainly one would not have
thought it possible; but there it is, in the museum at Angers,
close to the eye, where you can see and examine it. This is
glazing with a vengeance. It is not the sort of thing that any
one would undertake, except as a trial piece, to show his skill;
but if ever a glazier deserved his diploma of mastership here is
the man.</p>

<p>The composition of some of the windows belonging to the first half of
the seventeenth century at Troyes does not follow the general tendency
of the period. The better part of this, if not the greater, is
attributed to Linard Gontier (1606-1648). But the design of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
windows, and the style of them, is so varied, and sometimes so little of
the period, that one is disposed to think, either that he was a painter
only and did not design them at all, or that he borrowed his designs
freely from Italian and other sources. The panel on <a href="#Page_400">page 400</a>, the Virgin
girt with clouds and cherubs, distinctly recalls the work of the Della
Robbia School; and again the figures <a href="#Fig_169">opposite</a> remind one of late
sixteenth century paintings. An unusual thing, however, about some of
these windows is the way they are set out. The disposition of the design
of the three-light window from S. Martin √®s Vignes is as simple and
severe as though it had been Gothic. The glazing, too, is not in
squares, but follows the design. Except for the rather robustious
drawing of the figures, and the futile kind of detail which does duty
for canopy work, the glass might belong to the first half of the
sixteenth century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
Again, in the subject of the marriage of SS. Joachim and
Anna on <a href="#Page_234">page 234</a>, it is rather by the types of feature and the
cast of draperies, than by the composition, that the date of the
work proclaims itself. It is proclaimed, of course, unmistakably
by the use of enamel, not only in the warm-coloured flesh, but
throughout, to support, and sometimes to supply the place of,
pot-metal glass. Nevertheless, the effect of much of this glass
is brilliant to a degree almost unprecedented in the first half of
the seventeenth century. The painter had skill enough to get
the maximum of modelling with the minimum of paint. He
could afford, therefore, to use paint sparingly, leaving plenty of
glass clear, and seldom sacrificing its translucency, as was done
in the group of donors on <a href="#Page_81">page 81</a>, whose black mantles are
rendered in solid paint. Those heavily painted figures recall a
couple of Donors in a window at Antwerp (1626), equally black
robed, against a nearly black screen, all in paint: they would
have made a capital votive picture; but they are about as
unlike glass as anything one can conceive.</p>

<p>Exceptionally good seventeenth century work is to be found
also at Auch. It seems that it was proposed (towards 1650) to
complete the windows in a way worthy of the splendid beginning
in the choir; but the art was not forthcoming; and the
Chapter of that day was wise enough to fall back upon comparatively
unimportant quarry windows, with borders and
tracery in white and stain and blue enamel, which is at least
brilliant in colour, and pleasing in effect. That may be said
also of the Western Rose. In the Roses of the transepts, the
artist goes further, and produces, by means of arabesque in
white and stain, upon a ground mainly of blue and ruby, occasionally
varied by green, each light defined by a simple border
of white and stain, a couple of flamboyant Rose windows with
glass which would do credit to the period of the stonework.
They might well (at the distance they are placed from the eye)
be taken at first sight for Early Renaissance work. In fact
they are really mosaic glass&mdash;so rare a thing by this time that
the windows are probably of their kind unique.</p>

<p>Even at its best enamelled glass is less effective than the earlier
work. In proportion as the place of pot-metal is supplied by
enamel, the colour is inevitably diluted, and at times it is quite
thin. Indeed, it is pretty well proved, by the work of men who
are masters in their way, that, in painted as distinguished from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
mosaic glass, the choice lies between weak colour and opacity.
At Auch and at Troyes we have weak but still often pure and
brilliant colour.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 327px;">
<a id="Fig_170" name="Fig_170"></a>
<img src="images/fig_170.png" width="327" height="500" alt="St. Martin √®s Vignes, Troyes" title="St. Martin √®s Vignes, Troyes" />
</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">170. <span class="smcap">St. Martin √®s Vignes, Troyes.</span></span></p>

<p>The opposite defect of opacity reaches probably its greatest
depth in the four great Rubens-like windows at S. Gudule in
the chapel of Our Lady immediately opposite that of the
Holy Sacrament, where Van Orley&#8217;s windows are. The design
is there absolutely regardless of any consideration of glass or
architecture. Each window is treated as a vast oil picture,
without so much as a frame. Here is no vista of distant architecture,
nor any such relief of lighter colour as you find at
Gouda. Force of colour is sought by masses of deep shadow,
into which the figures merge. This shadow being obtained by
paint, and the glazing being in the now usual squares, there are
literally yards of painted quarries, which, except when the sun
is at its fiercest, are all but black. And withal the effect is not
rich as compared with even the common Gothic glass, though
it is not without a certain picturesqueness when perchance the
sun struggles through. A painter might find it an admirable
background to his picture; no architect would choose it for his
building. Three of these windows were designed, it seems, by
a pupil of Rubens, Van Thulden, who worked under him at
the Luxembourg, and they have all the character of his work&mdash;except
that the colour is dull.</p>

<p>At New College, Oxford, are some smaller windows with
figures, also recalling the manner of the master, and said to be
by pupils of his. They, too, are dull and heavy in effect. The
canopies over the figures are terrible caricatures of the Gothic
shrines in the ante-chapel. Better seventeenth century glass is
to be found at Oxford in the work of the Van Lingen, a family
of Dutchmen settled in England, who executed windows in
Wadham and Balliol Colleges and elsewhere. Some of these
are rich in colour. Apart from the rather interesting use of
enamel made in them, they are not of great value; but they
show as well as more important examples the kind of thing
which did duty for design.</p>

<p>The windows in Lincoln&#8217;s Inn Chapel, London, illustrate not
unfairly the dreary level of dulness as to colour and design
to which seventeenth century glass declined. That it could
fall still lower was shown, for example, by Peckitt, of York,
who is responsible for the glass on the north side of New
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a><br /><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>College Chapel, Oxford, facing the work of the Dutchmen.
These date from 1765 to 1774.</p>

<p>The history of eighteenth century windows may, if one may
plagiarise a famous bull, be put into the fewest possible words:
there were none&mdash;worth looking at. To find pleasure even in
Sir Joshua&#8217;s design at New College, you must consider it as
anything but glass.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<br />
PICTURE-WINDOWS.</h3>

<p>The course of glass design was picture-ward. Picture design,
however, did not stand still, and hence arises some confusion
in the use of the word &#8220;pictorial.&#8221; It is time to try and clear
that up. Stained glass, it may be truly said, has been from
the very first pictorial. The earliest glass, therefore, and the
latest, the best and the worst, may alike be termed pictorial.
The difference is in the conception as to what constituted a
picture, say, in the thirteenth century and the seventeenth. It
all depends upon the kind of picture attempted.</p>

<p>Archaic art aims already at nature. We probably do not
give the early painter credit enough for his intention of rendering
natural things naturally. In part at least the stiffness of
his design comes from lack of skill, and often where we find
him quaint he meant no doubt to be perfectly serious and
matter-of-fact. But it was not alone incompetence that held
his hand. He was restrained always by a decorative purpose
in his work. Here again he was not conscious of sacrificing to
any higher rule of art; he bothered himself as little about that
as a bee about the way it shall fashion its cell; he worked in the
way to which he was born; but the idea had not yet developed
itself that a picture could be painted quite apart from the decoration
of something, and it never entered his mind to do anything
but adapt himself to the decorative situation.</p>

<p>A picture, then, in medi√¶val times was a work of decorative
art, designed to fit a place, to fulfil part of a scheme of decoration,
in which it might more often than not take the first place,
but no more; it had no claim to independence.</p>

<p>In glass the picture obeyed two conditions which more or
less pulled together: as art it subserved to decorative and
architectural effect; as craftsmanship it acknowledged and
accepted the limitations of glass painting. In the course of
years the ideal of architectural fitness underwent successive
changes, and the limitations of the glass painter grew less; his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
scope, that is to say, was widened, and his art took what we
call more pictorial shape. Still, so long as the pictorial ideal
itself was restrained within the limits of medi√¶val ambition,
glass painting might safely approach the pictorial. It was
not until painting broke loose from traditional decorative
trammels and set up, so to speak, on its own account, until
pictorial came to mean something widely different from decorative,
that the term became in any way distinctive of one kind of
art or another. It is in that later sense that the word pictorial
is here used.</p>

<p>Artists still differ, and will continue to differ, as to the precise
use of the term. There are artists still who contend that,
since in old time art was decorative, and since in their opinion
all art should be decorative, therefore the picture which is not
decorative is not art. Arguing thus in a circle, they would say
(the pictorial including in their estimation the perfection of
decorative fitness, and all art which overshot the mark ceasing
to count with them) that art was always at its best when it
was most pictorial. But that is a species of quibbling about
words which not only leads us no further, but hinders mutual
understanding. It is wiser to accept words in the sense in
which they are generally understood, and to try and see where
the real difference of opinion is.</p>

<p>Difficult it may be, impossible even, to draw the line between
a picture which is decorative and decoration which is pictorial;
but there is no difficulty in drawing a band on one side of
which is decoration and on the other picture. You have only
to draw it wide enough. If we can succeed in defining a picture
as distinguished from a work of decorative art, and can
then show how a stained glass window, in attempting to conform
to conditions which we have agreed to call pictorial, fails
of its decorative function, it will then not be so difficult to see
how, in proportion as glass aims at the pictorial, it falls short
of making good windows. Granted, then, that a picture may
fulfil all decorative conditions, and that a decoration may sometimes
rightly be pictorial, that the two go, as historically they
did, a long way hand in hand, it is contended that there is a
point at which decoration and picture part company and take
distinctly different ways; thenceforth, if either is led away by
the other, it is at the cost of possible success in the direction
more peculiarly its own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
Now, the first point at which picture definitely parts company
with decoration is where the painter begins to consider
his work apart from its surroundings. The problems the artist
may set himself to solve are two. &#8220;How shall I adorn this
church, this clerestory, this chancel, this window, with stained
glass?&#8221;&mdash;that is distinctly a problem of the decorator; &#8220;How
shall I realise, on canvas or what not, this thought of mine,
this fact in nature, this effect seen or imagined?&#8221;&mdash;that is distinctly
a problem of the painter. Each, it is granted, may
be swayed more or less by the other consideration also, but
according as a man starts with the one problem or the other,
and seeks primarily to solve that, he is painter or decorator.
Suppose him seriously to endeavour to combine pictorial and
decorative qualities in his work, there will come times when
he has perforce to choose between the two. Upon the choice
he makes will hang the final character of his work, decorative
or pictorial.</p>

<p>We are too much in the habit of laying down laws as to
what a man may or may not do in art. He may do what
he can. He may introduce as much decorative intention into
his picture, as much pictorial effect into his decoration, as it
will stand; it is not till he overweights one with the other,
attempts more than his means or his power allow him, and
fails to do the thing that was to be done, that we can say he
has gone wrong.</p>

<p>When the two ideals of decoration and painting were more
nearly one, and in proportion as that was so, success in the
two directions was possible; when painting aimed at effects,
of painting&mdash;in proportion, that is, as it became pictorial&mdash;it
was impossible. It is safe to say, since masters attempted it
and failed&mdash;since, for example, the finest work in glass which
aims at the pictorial and depends upon painting ends always
in being either thin or opaque in effect&mdash;that the happy medium
was not found. The fact is, the time came when a painter,
in order to design successfully for glass, was called upon to
relinquish some of the effects he had come greatly to value
in painting: effects of light and shade, atmosphere, reflected
light, relief, perspective, violent foreshortening. To seek these
at the expense of qualities proper to decoration and to glass,
was to attempt picture; to sacrifice such pictorial qualities
to considerations of architectural fitness, to the quality of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
the glass, its translucency, its colour, its consistent treatment,
was to attempt decoration; and in proportion as the sacrifice
is not made, the work of the glass painter may be characterised
as &#8220;pictorial.&#8221; There should now be no possible
misunderstanding as to what is meant by the word. It
implies something of reproach, but only as applied to glass.
Let the pictorial flourish, in its place&mdash;that is, in picture.
All it is here meant to assert is that, pictures being what
they are, what they were already by the end of the sixteenth
century, the pictorial element in stained glass is bound to spoil
the window.</p>

<p>There are two respects in which a stained glass window
differs from a picture: first, in that it is a window; second, in
that it is glass. Suppose we take these two points separately.
It scarcely needs showing that the designing of a window is
a very different thing from the painting of a picture. In the
first place, the architectural frame of the window is there, arbitrarily
fixed, whereas the painter chooses his frame to suit his
picture. The designer of a window has not only to accept
the window-shape, but to respect both it and the architecture
of the building. The scale of his work, the main lines of its
composition, if not more, are practically determined for him
by architectural considerations, just as the depth of colour in
his scheme is determined by the position of his window and
the amount of light he desires &#8220;or is allowed&#8221; to shut out.
Moreover, he has to accept the window plane, to acknowledge
it as part of the building, to let you feel, whatever he does, that
it is a window you see, and not something through the window
or standing in it. That was tried, as we have seen, at Gouda
and S. Gudule; but, even if the illusion had been achieved, it
would have been destructive of architectural effect. The idea
of a picture seen through the mullions of a window is one of
the will-o&#8217;-the-wisps which led glass painters astray. They
did not succeed; and, had they done so, they would have
given a very false, and to some of us a very uncomfortable,
impression of not being protected from the outer air.</p>

<p>Mullions are in any case a very serious consideration. It
has been shown already (<a href="#Page_197">page 197</a>) how the artist sought
continuity of subject through the lights of his window, and
gradually extended his picture across them. And if he is at
liberty to occupy a four-light window with the Virgin and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Child and the Three Kings, and if it is lawful to introduce
more than one figure into a light, why may not each king be
accompanied by an attendant, holding his horse or bearing
gifts; why should not the Kings kneel in adoration; why
should not Joseph be there, the manger, and the cattle;
why should there not be one landscape stretching behind the
Magi, binding the whole into one picture? So with the Crucifixion.
If the Virgin and S. John may occupy sidelights, why
not introduce as well in a larger window the two thieves, the
Magdalene at the foot of the cross, the good centurion, the
soldiers, the crowd? Obviously there is no reason why the
subject should not be carried across a window; and from the
time that windows were divided into lights it was done, at all
events in the case of certain subjects, such as the Tree of Jesse,
which spread throughout the window, or the Last Judgment,
for which the available space was yet never enough.</p>

<p>But there is a wide difference between designing a subject
which extends through the whole width of a window and
designing it so that it appears to be seen through the window.
In the one case the mullions are seriously taken into account;
in the other they are ignored. If you were looking at a scene
through a window, of course the mullions would interfere.
Why, therefore, consider them if you wish to produce the effect
of something seen through? Naturally you would not allow the
stonework to cut across the face of a principal personage, or
anything of that kind; but, apart from that, its intervention
would only add to the air of reality. The problem of dealing
with the mullions is thus rather shirked than solved. Its
solution is not really so difficult as would seem. Mullions
count for much less in the window than one would suppose.
The eye, for example, follows naturally the branches of a Tree
of Jesse from one light into another, and it is not felt that the
stonework interferes with it at all seriously, whilst the scheming
of the figures, each within a single light, is a very distinct
acknowledgment of its individuality. So in the case of a
subject. If the design is so planned that the important figures
are grouped in separate lights, the landscape or other continuous
background helps to hold the picture together, and is not hurt
by the mullions.</p>

<p>The important thing is that mullions should be considered;
only on that condition do they cease to interfere with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
design. There is no reason always to put a border round
each light, or even to keep every figure within the bounds of
a single light. A reclining figure, such as that of Jesse at the
base of the window (<a href="#Fig_171">below</a>), Jacob asleep and dreaming, or the
widow&#8217;s son upon the bier, may safely cross two or three lights,
if it be designed with reference to the intervening stonework.</p>

<p>Further, it seems desirable that the shape of each separate
window opening should be acknowledged by at least a narrow
fillet of white or pale colour next the masonry, broken, it may
be, here and there by some feature designed to hold the lights
together, but practically clearing the colour from the stonework,
and giving to the division of the window the slight
emphasis it deserves. It is not worth while dividing a window
into lights and then effacing the divisions in the glass. Given
a window of four or five lights, the decorator has no choice but
to design a four or five-light window. He must render his
subject so that the constructional divisions of the window keep
their proper architectural place; if his subject will not allow
that, he must abandon his subject, or give very good reason why
not. The reason of mere pictorial ambition will not hold good.
The test of a good picture-window is, how the mullions affect
the design. If to take them away would make it look foolish,
then it has probably been designed as a window, decoratively;
if to take them away would improve it, then it has been designed
pictorially; and, however good a picture it might have been, it
is a bad window design.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">171. <span class="smcap">S. Mary&#8217;s, Shrewsbury.</span></span></p>

<p>It is quite possible, nay, probable, that in connection with
any given window, or series of windows, there will be archi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>tectural
features which deserve to be emphasised. It may be
the springing of the arch which calls for accentuation; it may
be a string-course in the walls that asks for recognition; it
may be that the proportion of the window wants correction.
Whatever it be, it is the part of the decorator to feel the want
and to meet it, to grasp the situation and to accept it. In not
doing so, he shows perhaps pictorial, certainly not decorative,
instinct. So with regard to the plane of a glass picture. It is
not necessary to restrict one&#8217;s design to silhouette, to make
one&#8217;s picture as flat as the first glass painters or the Greek
vase painters made theirs. How much of distance and relief a
man may indulge in is partly his own affair. It depends upon
what he can manage to do without destroying the surface of
his window. So long as he preserve that, he may do as he
pleases, and yet not lay himself open to the charge of being
unduly pictorial; only it is as well to remember that on the
simplest and severest lines grand work has been done, and may
still be done, without falling into archaism; whilst the Crabeths,
and the rest of the astoundingly clever glass painters of Gouda
fail to reconcile us to the attempt to render the sky beyond
(<a href="#Page_258">page 258</a>) or distant architectural vistas in glass.</p>

<p>It has sometimes been contended that all lines of perspective
(which in the sixteenth century begin to take a very important
place in design) are amiss in glass, inasmuch as they destroy
its flatness. That is surely to go too far. So long as no effect
of relief is sought, no effect of distance attempted, no illusion
aimed at, one can hardly find fault with lines indicating the
perspective necessary perhaps to the expression of the design&mdash;assuming,
of course, that the lines of perspective take their
place in the decorative scheme, and help the composition of
the window. They do that very cleverly in Crabeth&#8217;s picture
of &#8220;Christ Purifying the Temple&#8221; (<a href="#Page_244">page 244</a>). Our complaint
is rather with the strong relief attempted, the abuse of
shadow, and especially of painted shadow. The case is far
worse where, as at S. Eustache, Paris, the architectural
background is shown obliquely. In that case, no uncommon
one in the seventeenth century, when the painter would just
as likely as not choose his point of view as best suited his
picture, without any reference whatever to its architectural
setting, the painter shows himself, as glass painter, at his most
pictorial and worst.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
So much for the window as an architectural feature, now let
us look at it as glass.</p>

<p>It becomes here very much a question of craftsmanship.
To a workman it seems so natural, and so obvious, that the
material he is working in, and the tools he is using, must from
beginning to end affect the treatment of his design, that it
appears almost unnecessary to insist upon such a truism.
Experience, however, goes to show that only the workman
and here and there a man who ought, perhaps, to have been one,
have any appreciation of what artists call treatment. The rest
of the world have heard tell that there is such a thing as technique,
to which they think far too much importance is attached.
That is so, indeed, when artists think technique is enough; but
not when they look upon it as indispensable, the beginning of
all performance, not when they insist that a man shall know
the grammar of his art before he breaks out into poetry.</p>

<p>Now the A, B, C, of workmanship is to treat each material
after its kind. It is a truism, therefore, to say that glass should
be treated as glass. Yet we find that a man may be enthusiastic
to a degree about an art, learned above most men in
its history, and yet end in entirely misconceiving its scope.
&#8220;What is to be condemned on canvas,&#8221; said Winston, &#8220;ought
not to be admitted on glass.&#8221; As well might he have said, that
what would be condemned on glass should not be allowed on
canvas, or that language and behaviour which would be unbecoming
in church should not be tolerated on the platform, or
at the dinner-table.</p>

<p>The fallacy that one rule applies to all forms of art is responsible
alike for the muddiness of seventeenth and eighteenth
century windows and for the thin transparent tinting of nineteenth
century Munich glass.</p>

<p>That &#8220;art is one&#8221; is a fine saying, rightly understood. So
is humanity one, and it is well to remind ourselves of the fact;
but race, climate, country, count for something; and to speak
with effect we must speak the language of the land. Each
separate craft included in the all-embracing title of art, and
making for its good and its glory, works under conditions as
definite as those of climate, has characteristics as marked as
those of nationality, and speaks also a language of its own. And,
to express itself to full purpose, it must speak in its own tongue.
The only pictures, then, which prove satisfactory in glass are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
the pictures of the glass painter; and by glass painter is not meant any
one who may choose to try his hand at glass painting, but the man who
has learnt his trade and knows it from end to end, to whom use has
become second nature, who thinks in glass, as we say. Now and again,
perhaps, where a draughtsman and a glass painter are in unusual
sympathy, it may be possible for the one to translate the design of the
other into the language of his craft; but good translators are rare, and
translation is at best second-hand. Success in glass is achieved mainly
by the man to whom ideas come in the form of glass, who sees them first
in his mind&#8217;s eye as windows. Even such a man may lack taste, insight,
discretion; he may be led away by a misplaced ambition&mdash;it is not
merely on the stage that the low comedian aspires to play
Hamlet&mdash;but only the man who knows so well the dangers ahead that
he insensibly avoids them, who knows so surely what can be got out of
his material that he makes straight for that, who does, in short, the
best that can be done in glass, can dare to be &#8220;pictorial&#8221; without
danger of being false to his trade.</p>

<p>A painter without experience of glass might, of course, be coached in
the technique of the material; but he would never get the most out of
it. Conditions which to the glass painter would be as easy as an old
coat, would be a restraint to him, and the greater his position the more
impatient he would be of such restraint, the more surely his will would
override the better judgment of the subordinate who happened to know.</p>

<span class="caption">172. <span class="smcap">Christ purging the Temple, Gouda.</span></span>
</div>

<p>It was unfortunate that at a critical period in the history of
glass, just when great painters from the outside began to be
called in to design for it, knowledge was in rather an uncertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
state. The use of enamel had been discovered; it offered
undoubted facilities to the painter; it was believed in; it was
the fashion. Any one who had protested the superiority of the
old method would possibly have been set down as an old fogey,
even by glass painters. At that moment, very likely, a glass
painter, anxious of course to conciliate the great man, but
flushed also with faith in his new-found method, would have
said to Van Orley, in reply to any question about technique:&mdash;&#8220;Never
you mind about glazing and all that; give us a design,
and we will execute it in glass.&#8221; And he did execute it in a
masterly and quite wonderful way. Still the success of it is
less than it would have been had the designer known all about
glass: in that case his artistic instinct would have led him
surely to trust more to qualities inherent in glass, and less to
painting upon it. Van Orley&#8217;s picture scheme depended too
much upon relief to be really well adapted to glass, but it was
splendidly monumental in design, and to that extent admirably
decorative. Something of decorative restraint we find almost
to the end in sixteenth century work; the picture had not yet
emancipated itself entirely, and the pictorial ideal did not
therefore necessarily go beyond what glass could do; in any
case, it did not take quite a different direction.</p>

<p>It may be as well to define more precisely the ideal glass
picture. The ideal glass picture is, the picture which gives full
scope for the qualities of glass, and does not depend in any way
upon effects which cannot be obtained in glass, or which are to
be attained only at the sacrifice of qualities peculiar to it.</p>

<p>And what are those qualities? The qualities of glass are
light and colour, a quality of light and a quality of colour to
be obtained no other way than by the transmission of light
through pot-metal glass.</p>

<p>Compare these qualities with those of oil painting, and see
how far they are compatible. Something depends upon the
conception of oil painting. The qualities of glass are compatible
enough with the pictorial ideal of the oil (or more
likely tempera) painters whom we designate by the name of
&#8220;primitives&#8221;; and, indeed, fifteenth century Italian windows
often take the form of circular pictures which one of the masters
might have designed. A painting by Botticelli, Filippo Lippi,
Mantegna, or Crivelli, might almost be put into the hands of a
glass painter to translate. It is quite possible that some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
Florentine windows were executed in Germany from paintings
by Italian masters; the odd thing is that they are attributed
sometimes to sculptors. Ghiberti and Donatello may, for all
one knows, have been great colourists; but it is so universal a
foible to ascribe works of decorative art to famous painters
or sculptors who could never by any possibility have had a
hand in them, that one never has much faith in such reputed
authorship.</p>

<p>The severity of the &#8220;primitive&#8221; painters&#8217; design, the firm
outline, the comparatively flat treatment, the brilliant, not
yet degraded, colour&mdash;all these were qualities which the glass
painter could turn to account. Without firm and definite outline,
of course, a design does not lend itself to mosaic. But it
is especially the early painter&#8217;s ideal of colour which was so
sympathetic to the glass painter. A designer for glass must be
a colourist; but the colour he seeks is <i>sui generis</i>. Not every
colourist would make a glass designer. Van Thulden may not
have been a colourist of his master&#8217;s stamp, but Peter Paul
Rubens himself could not have made a complete success of
those windows in the Chapel of Our Lady in S. Gudule.
Reynolds was a colourist, but he came conspicuously to grief
in glass. Velasquez was a colourist, but one fails to see how
by any possibility the quality of his work could be expressed
in glass.</p>

<p>On the other hand, colour in which the simple artist delighted,
as in light and sunshine, in the sparkle of the sea, in the purity
of the sky, in the brilliancy of flowers, in the flash of jewels, in
the deep verdure of moss, in the lusciousness of fruit or wine,
colour as the early Florentine painters saw it and sought it&mdash;this
is what glass can give, and gives better than oil, tempera,
or fresco, on an opaque surface. How far these early painters
deliberately sacrificed to pure bright colour qualities of light
and shade, aerial perspective, and so on, may be open to
question. The certain thing is that, if we want the quality of
glass in all its purity and translucency, we have to sacrifice to
it something of the light and shade, the relief, the atmospheric
effect, the subtlety of realistic colour, which we are accustomed
nowadays to look for in a picture. Happy the men
who could contentedly pursue their work undisturbed by the
thought that there were effects to be obtained in art beyond
what it was possible for them to get.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
Even the Italian painters soon travelled beyond the limits
of what could possibly be done in glass. Flesh-painting, as
Titian understood it, or Correggio, or Bonifacio, is hopelessly
beyond its range. But it was the Dutch who formed
for themselves the idea most widely and hopelessly beyond
realisation in glass. The Crabeths, like good glass painters,
struggled more or less against it; but they could not keep out
of the current altogether; and in proportion as their work
aims at anything like chiaroscuro it loses its quality of glass.
Rembrandt, to have realised his ideal in glass, would have had
to paint out of it every quality which distinguishes it and gives
it value. In proportion, as the painter&#8217;s aim was light and
shade rather than colour, and especially as it was shade rather
than light (or perhaps it would be fairer to say, as it was light
intensified by obscuring light around it) it was diametrically
opposed to that of the glass painter. His pursuit of it was a
sort of artistic suicide. It led by quick and sure degrees to
what was to all intents and purposes the collapse of glass
painting. Realism of a kind was inevitable when once the
painter gained the strength to realise what he saw, but when
the glass painter, seeking the strength of actual light and
shade, began to rely upon painted shadow for his effects, the
case was hopeless. Glass asks to be translucent.</p>

<p>The point of perfection in glass design is not easily to be
fixed. Glass painting, it must be confessed, as it approaches
perfection of technique, is always dangerously near the border
line; the painter is so often tempted to carry his handiwork a
little further than is consistent with the translucency of glass.
It happens, therefore, that one expects almost to find consummate
drawing and painting marred by some obscuration of the
glass. If on the other hand we travel back to the time when
the evil does not exist, we find ourselves at a period when
neither drawing nor painting were at their best. It is by no
means surprising that this should be the outcome of the
association of glazier and painter. According as one cares
more for glass or for painting one will be disposed to shift,
backwards or forwards, the date at which glass painting began
to decline. It may safely be said, however, that pictorial glass
painting was at its best during the first half of the sixteenth
century. That is the period during which you may expect to
find masterly drawing, consummate painting, and yet sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
recognition of the character of glass to satisfy all but the
staunch partisan of pure mosaic glass&mdash;who, by the way, stands
upon very firm ground.</p>

<p>In Flanders, as has been said, and in France, are to be
found exquisite pictures in glass, admirably decorative in design,
glowing with jewel-like brilliancy of colour, not seriously obscured
by paint, the figures modelled with a delicacy reminding
one rather of sculpture in very low relief than of more realistic
painting and carving, the colour delicate and yet not thin, the
effect strong without brutality.</p>

<p>But it is in Italy that are to be seen probably the finest
glass pictures that have ever been painted; the work, nevertheless,
of a Frenchman&mdash;William of Marseilles&mdash;who established
himself at Arezzo, and painted, amongst other glass,
five windows for the cathedral there, which go about as far
as glass can go in the direction of picture. The man was a
realist in his way&mdash;realist, that is, so far as suited his artistic
purpose. Not merely are his figures studied obviously from
the life, but they are conceived in the realistic spirit, as when,
in the scene of the Baptism, he draws a man getting into his
clothes with the difficulty we have all experienced after bathing,
or when, in the Raising of Lazarus (<a href="#Page_397">page 397</a>), he makes more
than one onlooker hold his nose as the grave-clothes are unwrapped
from the body. In design the artist is quite up to
the high level of his day (1525 or thereabouts); but you see all
through his work that it was colour, always colour, that made
his heart beat (we have here nothing to do with the religious
sentiment which may or may not be embodied in his work),
colour that prompted his design, as in the case of so many a
great Italian master.</p>

<p>This man possibly did in glass much what <i>he</i> would have
done on canvas; but he could never have got such pure,
intense, and at the same time luminous, effects of colour
in anything but glass, and he knew it, never lost sight of it,
and tried to get the most out of what it could best give him&mdash;that
is to say, purity of colour, and translucency and
brilliancy of glass. Whatever amount of pigment he employed
(probably more than it seems, the light is so strong in Italy)
it seldom appears to do more than just give the needful
modelling. Now and again, in the architectural parts of his
composition, the white is lowered by means of a matt of paint,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
where a tint of deeper-coloured glass had better have been
employed; but even there the effect is neither dirty nor
in the least heavy. And in the main, for all his pictorial
bias, the system of the artist is distinctly mosaic; his colour
is pot-metal always or purest stain. The sky and the landscape,
for example, in which the scene of the Baptism is laid,
are leaded up in tints of blue and green. In the scene where
Christ purges the Temple the pavement is of clear aquamarine-tinted
glass, against which the scales, moneybags,
overturned bench, and so on, stand out in quite full enough
relief of red and yellow, without any aid of heavy shading,
or cast shadow, such as a Netherlander would have used.</p>

<p>And, for all that, the difficulty even of foreshortening is
boldly faced. Not even in the most violently shaded Flemish
glass would it be easy to find a figure more successfully
foreshortened than the kneeling money-changer, scooping
up his money into a bag. That a designer could do this
without strong shading, means that he was careful to choose
the pose or point of view which allowed itself to be expressed
in lightly painted glass. There is no riotous indulgence in
perspective, but distance is sufficiently indicated; and the personages
in the background, drawn to a smaller scale than the
chief actors in the scene, keep their place in the picture.
Everywhere it is apparent that the figures have been composed
with a cunning eye to glazing.</p>

<p>These are not pictures which have been done into glass; they
are no translations, but the creations of a glass painter&mdash;one
who knew all about glass, and instinctively designed only what
could be done in it, and best done. This man makes full use
of all the resources of his art. His window is constructed as
only a glazier could do it. He does not shirk his leads. He
uses abrasion freely, not so much to save glazing, as to get
effects not otherwise possible. Thus the deep red skirt or
petticoat of the woman taken in adultery is dotted with white
in a way that bespeaks at a glance the woman of the people,
whilst more sumptuous draperies of red and green are, as it
were, embroidered with gold, or sewn with pearls. These are
the effects he aims at, not the mere texture of silk or velvet.
He delights in delicate stain on white, and revels in most
gorgeous stain upon stain. In short, these are pictures indeed,
but the pictures of a glass painter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
Work like this disarms criticism. One may have a strong
personal bias towards strictly mosaic glass, and yet acknowledge
that success justifies departure from what one thought
the likelier way. Things of beauty decline to be put away
always in the nice little pigeon-holes we have carefully provided
for them. Shall we be such pedants as to reject them because
they do not fit in with our preconceived ideas of fitness?</p>

<p>Alas!&mdash;or happily?&mdash;alas for what might have been, happily
for our wavering allegiance to sterner principles of design, it is
seldom that the glass painter so perfectly tunes his work to the
key of glass. In particular, he finds it difficult to harmonise
his painting with the glazing which goes with it. He is
incapable in the early sixteenth century of the brutalities of his
successors, who carry harsh lines of lead across flesh painting
recklessly; but the very association of ultra-delicate painting
with lead lines at all demands infinite tact. An idea of the
point to which painting is eventually carried may be gathered
from the representation of little nude boys blowing bubbles in
which are reflected the windows of the room where they are
supposed to be playing. That is an extreme instance, and a
late one. Short, however, of such frivolity, and in work of the
good period, painting is often so delicate that bars and leads
unquestionably hurt it. It is so even in the very fine Jesse
window at Beauvais (<a href="#Page_368">page 368</a>).</p>

<p>Occur where it may it is a false note which stops our admiration
short; and, after all our enthusiasm, we come back heart-whole
to our delight in the earlier, bolder, more monumental,
and more workmanlike mosaic glass. The beautiful sixteenth
century work at Montmorency or at Conches does not shake
the conviction of the glass-lover, that the painter is there a
little too much in evidence, that something of simple, dignified
decoration is sacrificed to the display of his skill. The balance
between glass decoration and picture is perhaps never more
nearly adjusted than in some of the rather earlier Italian
windows.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<br />
LANDSCAPE IN GLASS.</h3>

<p>At once a distinguishing feature of picture-glass, and a characteristic
of later work generally, is the <i>mise-en-sc√®ne</i> of the subject.</p>

</div>

<p>In quite the earliest glass the figures, it was shown, were cut out
against a ground of plain colour (<a href="#Page_33">pages 33</a>, <a href="#Page_127">127</a>), or diapered perhaps
with a painted pattern, or leaded up in squares, or broken by spots of
pot-metal (<a href="#Page_37">page 37</a>), which, by the way, being usually of too strongly
contrasting colour, assert themselves instead of qualifying its tone.
Sometimes the ground was leaded up in the form of a more or less
elaborate geometric diaper (<a href="#Page_336">page 336</a>). Occasionally it was broken by the
simplest possible conventional foliage. The figure stood on a cloud, an
inscribed label, a disc or band of earth. In the fourteenth century
spots breaking the ground took very often the form of badges,
<i>fleurs-de-lys</i>, heraldic animals, cyphers, and so on (<a href="#Page_156">page 156</a>), and
even in the fifteenth it was quite common to find figures against a flat
ground, broken only by inscription, either on white or yellow labels
(<a href="#Page_186">pages 186</a>, <a href="#Page_339">339</a>), or leaded in bold letters of white or yellow into the
background itself (<a href="#Page_196">page 196</a>). But simultaneously with this the figure
was frequently represented against a screen of damask (<a href="#Page_191">page 191</a>), above
which showed the further background, usually more or less architectural
in character. In the Fairford windows (<a href="#Page_187">page 187</a>) is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a><br />
<a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> shown this
treatment together with the label which helps to break the formality of
the horizontal line. Sometimes the line is curved, as though the figure
stood in a semicircular niche, or broken, as though the recess were
three-sided. Sometimes the figure stood upon a pedestal (<a href="#Page_391">page 391</a>), but
more usually, as time went on, upon a pavement. Certain subjects were
bound to include accessory architecture, but at first it was as simple
as the scenery in the immortal play of <i>Pyramus and Thisbe</i>. But even in
the fifteenth century it was rendered, one may judge how na√Øvely, from
the little Nativity on <a href="#Page_54">page 54</a>, a subject hardly to be rendered without
the stable. Again, the quite conventional vinework, also from Malvern,
shown in the upper part of <a href="#Page_345">page 345</a> (a jumble of odds and ends), forms
really part of the scene depicting Noah in his vineyard&mdash;see the
hand holding the spade handle. The Fairford scenery (<a href="#Page_251">pages 251</a>, <a href="#Page_372">372</a>),
quaint as it is, goes much nearer to realism than that; and towards the
sixteenth century, and during its first years, there was a good deal of
landscape in which trees were leaded in vivid green against blue, with
gleaming white stems suggestive of birch-bark, always effective, and
refreshingly cool in colour. There is something of that kind in the
window facing the entrance to King&#8217;s College, Cambridge; but the more
usual English practice in the fifteenth century was to execute the
landscape in white and stain against a coloured ground. That is the
system adopted in the scene of the Creation at Malvern (<a href="#Page_252">page 252</a>), where
trees, water, birds, fishes, are all very delicately painted and
stained. In the left-hand corner it will be seen that solid or nearly
solid brown is used for foliage in order to throw up the white and
yellow leafage in front of it. There is some considerably later work
very much in this manner at S. Nizier, Troyes. But that kind of thing
was not usual in French glass.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 384px;">
<a id="Fig_174" name="Fig_174"></a>

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">174. <span class="smcap">From The Creation, Malvern Abbey.</span></span></p>

<p>The sky had of course from the first been indicated by a
blue background; but, the blue ground being used, in alternation
with ruby, for all backgrounds, except a few in white,
it was not distinctive enough to suggest the heavens, without
some indication of clouds, which accordingly were leaded
up upon it, sometimes in mere streaks of colour, sometimes
in fantastically ornamental shapes. It was a later thought,
which came with the use of paler glass, to paint the blue with
clouds, indicating them, that is to say, more or less in the form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
of diaper. As with the sky so with the sea. It was at first
glazed in wave pattern; eventually the wave lines were painted
on the blue.</p>

<p>The blue background, which had gradually become paler and
paler, became soon in the sixteenth century pale enough to
stand approximately for a grey-blue sky, on which was painted,
with marvellous delicacy, distant landscape, architecture, or
what not, always in the brown tint used generally for shading,
although a tint of green was given to grass and trees by the
use of yellow stain.  This distant view painted upon blue
was a beautiful and most characteristic feature of sixteenth
century glass. The French painters adopted it, and made
it peculiarly their own, though it occurs also in German
and Flemish glass. Backgrounds of this kind, which in themselves
suffice to mark the departure from Gothic use, are
shown on <a href="#Page_207">pages 207</a>, <a href="#Page_213">213</a>, and on a larger scale <a href="#Fig_175">opposite</a>. The
wintry landscape there with the bare tree trunks against
the cold grey sky, forms the upper portion of the subject
shown on <a href="#Page_207">page 207</a>, in which Our Lord gives His charge to
Peter; the paler grey behind the heads of the group stands
for the sea. The wintry effect of the scene is not suggestive of
the Holy Land, but it brings the subject innocently home to
us. The leads, it will be seen, take the lines of the larger
limbs of the trees, whilst the lesser branches and small twigs
are painted on the glass. There is ingenuity in the glazing
as well as delicacy in the painting. This is a very different
thing from the landscape painted in enamel colours.  The
propriety, the beauty, the decorative quality of such work as
this, comes of the acceptance of the necessary convention of
treating the painted background, of rendering it, that is, always
more or less in monochrome, and not attempting anything
like realism in colour.</p>

<p>The painted landscapes illustrated are of the simplest.
The French painters went much further than that, associating
with their painting broad masses of pot-metal colour, but
still keeping distinctly within the convention of deliberately
simple colour. By the use of silvery-white and shades of pot-metal
blue and purple and green, they produced the most
pleasing and harmonious effects. There was no great variety
in the tune they played, but the variations upon it were infinite.
Let us picture here a few of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
1. <i>Ecouen.</i>&mdash;A distant city, in white, and beyond that more
distant architecture, painted on the pale blue of the sky.</p>

<p>2. <i>Conches.</i>&mdash;Against a pale blue sky, broken by cumulous
white clouds, a grey-blue tower.</p>

<p>3. <i>Conches.</i>&mdash;A grey-blue sea and deeper sky beyond: from
the waves rises a castle, in white, breaking the sky-line, the
pointed roofs of its turrets painted in black upon the background.</p>

<span class="caption">175. <span class="smcap">Background to the Charge of S. Peter, S. Vincent, Rouen. (<a href="#Fig_156">Comp. 156.</a>)</span></span>
</div>

<p>4. <i>Freiburg, 1528.</i>&mdash;A smoke-grey sea, fading away towards
the horizon into pale silver, the sky beyond dark blue, its
outline broken by a range of deeper blue mountains.</p>

<p>5. <i>Conches.</i>&mdash;Beyond the foreground landscape in rich green,
a pale blue sea, with slightly deeper grey-blue sky beyond,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
a tower in darker blue against it; a strip of deep blue shore
divides the sky and sea, and gives support to the dark tower;
against that a smaller tower catches the light, and stands out
in glittering white.</p>

<p>6. <i>Montmorency.</i>&mdash;A canopied figure subject in gorgeous
colour; the foreground a landscape with rich green herbage,
separated by a belt of white cliffs from buildings of pale grey,
amidst trees stained greenish, backed by purple hills; further
a pale blue sky; against the sky, overshadowed beneath the
canopy arch by a mass of purple cloud, the stained and painted
foliage of a tree, growing from this side the hill.</p>

<p>7. <i>Montmorency.</i>&mdash;S. Christopher crossing the stream; blue
water painted with waves and water plants, the foliage stained.</p>

<p>8. <i>S. Nizier, Troyes.</i>&mdash;A vineyard, very prettily managed; the
vines painted on the blue, their leaves stained to green, the
grapes grey-blue, whilst grey stakes are leaded in pot-metal.</p>

<p>Sometimes, as at Ecouen, far-off architecture would be painted
not upon blue but upon a pale purple hill. At Laigle figures
and animals are painted upon green, but they do not hold their
own. On the other hand, at Alen√ßon, some distant figures
appearing in very pale grey against a delicate greenish landscape
(stained upon the grey), are charming in effect.</p>

<p>White backgrounds painted as delicately as the blue are
not rare. At Groslay, for example, steely-white architecture
is separated from white sky beyond by grey-blue hills, a church
with blue steeple breaking the sky. But white does not lend
itself so readily to combination with colour as blue; and, as a
rule, such backgrounds are grisaille in character, relieved, of
course, with stain.</p>

<p>The great sea-scape at Gouda (<a href="#Page_223">page 223</a>), representing the
taking of Dalmatia in Egypt (a very Dutch Dalmatia), is
nearly all in grisaille, against quarries of clear white, with
only a little stain in the flags and costumes, and one single
touch of poor ruby (about two inches square), which looks as
if it might be modern. The port in perspective, the ships, the
whole scene, in fact, is realistically rendered, and comes as near
to success as is possible in glass.</p>

<p>Delightful peeps of landscape are sometimes seen through the
columns and arches of an architectural background. Whether
the architecture be in purple of divers shades, or in white
with only shadows in purple, or whether the nearer archi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>tecture
be in white and the more distant in purple, in any
case a distance beyond is commonly painted upon the grey-blue
sky seen through it. Possibly, as at Conches, further vistas
of architecture may be stained greenish upon it&mdash;any colour
almost, for a change. But whatever it may be, and wherever
it may be, in the best work it is colour; and it is always more
effective than where the shadow is represented by paint, even
though the brown be not laid on with a heavy hand, infinitely
more effective than when blue or other coloured enamels are
relied upon, as in some instances at Montmorency. Enamel
may, for all one can tell, have been used in some of the
landscapes here commended&mdash;it is impossible to say without
minute examination of the glass, which is rarely feasible&mdash;but
it never asserts its presence; and in any case it has not been
used in sufficient quantity to damage the effect.</p>

<p>It will be gathered from the descriptions of early sixteenth
century glazed and painted distances, that they were as carefully
schemed with a view to glazing (though in a very different way)
as a Gothic picture. Sometimes, as at Conches, they are rather
elaborately leaded; and where that is the case there is not so
much danger of incongruity between the delicacy of the painting
and the strength of the leads&mdash;which assert themselves less than
where they occur singly. It stands to reason also that the
more mosaic the glass the less fragile it is. Painting alone
upon the blue is best employed for small peeps of distance. It
adapts itself to smaller windows; and it must be done (as for a
while it was done) so well, that it seems as if the designer
must himself have painted it. Were the artist always the glass
painter, and the glass painter always an artist, who knows what
case pictorial glass might not make out for itself?</p>

<span class="caption">176. <span class="smcap">The Relief of Leyden, Gouda.</span></span>
</div>

<p>It is a coarser kind of distance than the French that we
find at King&#8217;s College, Cambridge. There the landscape backgrounds
are in white and stain, grey-blue being reserved for
the sky beyond, broken more or less by white clouds, or, occasionally,
by the white trunks of trees, the foliage of which is
sometimes glazed in green glass, sometimes painted upon the
blue and stained. Here and there a distant tree is painted
entirely upon the blue. This treatment is not ill adapted to
subjects on the large scale of the work at King&#8217;s College,
but one does not feel that the painters made anything like
the most of their opportunity.  The inexperience of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
designers is shown in their fear of using leads, a most unnecessary
fear, seeing that, at the distance the work is from
the eye, the bars themselves have only about the value of
ordinary lead lines.</p>

<p>Stronger and more workmanlike, but not quite satisfactory, is the much
later landscape (1557) of Dirk Crabeth at Gouda. There the sky is blue,
leaded in quarries, on which are trees, painted and stained, and some
rather florid clouds. In the later work generally the lead lines are no
longer either frankly acknowledged or skilfully disguised. The outline
of a green hill against the sky will be feebly softened with trivial
little twigs and scraps of painted leafage. The decline of landscape is
amply illustrated at Troyes. At Antwerp again there is a window bearing
date 1626, in which the landscape background of a quite incomprehensible
subject extends to a distant horizon, above which the sky is glazed in
white quarries, with clouds painted upon it. This is an attempt to
repeat the famous feat of glass painting which had been done some twenty
years before at Gouda. The Relief of Leyden, of which a diagram is here
given, is in its way a most remarkable glass picture. In the foreground
is a crowd of soldiers and citizens, upon the quay, about lifesize. They
form a band of rich colour at the base of the composition; but the
design is confused by the introduction of shields of arms and their
supporters immediately in front of the scene. Beyond are the walls and
towers of the city of Delft, and the adjacent towns and villages, and
the river dwindling into the far distance where Leyden lies&mdash;in the
glass a really marvellous bird&#8217;s-eye view over characteristically flat
country. The horizon extends almost to the springing line of the window
arch, and above that rises a sky of plain blue quarries, broken
only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> towards the top by a few bolster-like and rather dirty
white clouds. Absolute realism is of course not reached, but it is
approached near enough to startle us into admiration. It is astonishing
what has here been done. But the painter has not done what he meant to
do. That was not possible, even with the aid of enamel.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<br />
ITALIAN GLASS.</h3>

<p>In the course of the preceding chapters the reader has been
rather unceremoniously carried from country to country, in a
way which may have seemed to him erratic. But there was
a reason in the zig-zag course taken. The progress of the glass
painter&#8217;s art was not by any means a straight line. Nor did it
develop itself on parallel lines in the various countries in which
it throve. It advanced in one place whilst it was almost at
a standstill in another.</p>

<p>That is easily understood. It was inevitable that glass
painting, though it arose in France, should languish there
during the troublous times when English troops overran it
under Edward III. and throughout the Hundred Years&#8217; War,
that it should revive in all its glory under Francis the First,
and that during the disturbances of the Fronde it should
again decline. The extremity of France was England&#8217;s opportunity;
and our greatest wealth of stained glass windows dates
from the reign of the later Plantagenets. The Wars of the
Roses do not appear greatly to have affected art; but after
the Reformation we were more busy smashing glass than
painting it.</p>

<p>In Germany the course of art ran smoother. Glass throve
under the Holy Roman Empire, and it was not until the
Reformation that it suffered any very severe check. Medi√¶val
Swiss glass may be classed with German.</p>

<p>In the Netherlands glass painting blossomed out suddenly
under the Imperial favour of Charles V. It continued to bear
fruit under the Dutch Republic, until it ran to seed at the end
of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>So it happens that, in following the development of glass
painting, it has been necessary to seek the best and most
characteristic illustrations first in one country and then in
another, to travel from France to England, from England to
Germany and back to France, thence to Flanders, to France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
again, and finally once more to the Netherlands, to say nothing
of shorter excursions from one place to another, as occasion
might demand. In each separate locality there was naturally
some sort of progress, but we cannot take any one country as
all-sufficient type of the rest; and to have traversed each
in turn would have been tedious. There were everywhere
differences of practice and design; in each country, for that
matter, there were local schools with marked characteristics
of their own. Some of the characteristic national differences
have been pointed out in passing. To describe them at
length would be to write a comparative history of glass, of
which there is here no thought. What concerns us is the
broadly marked progress of glass painting, not the minor local
differences in style.</p>

<p>Something more, however, remains to be said of Italian
glass than was possible in any general survey. The mere facts,
that the Renaissance arose in Italy so long before it reached
this side the Alps, and that glass painting was never really quite
at home in Italy (any more than the Gothic architecture
which mothered it), sufficiently account for the difficulty, nay,
the impossibility, of classing it according to the Gothic periods.
Indeed, one is reminded in Italian glass less often of other
windows of the period, English, French, or German, than of
contemporary Italian painting.</p>

<p>The comparative fitness of the works of the &#8220;Primitive&#8221;
painters for models of glass design has already been pointed
out. It is so evident that the Italian sense of colour could
find more adequate expression than ever in glass, that one is
inclined to wonder, until it is remembered that Italian churches
were at the same time picture galleries, that it did not more
commonly find vent in that medium. Even as it is, Italian
painters did found a school of glass painting, comparatively
uninfluenced by the traditional Gothic types of design, whilst
observing the best traditions of glazier-like technique. Hence
it is that we find in Italy windows such as are nowhere else to
be seen, windows which at their best are of the very best.</p>

<p>There are resemblances in Italian glass to German work;
and some of it is said to have been executed by Germans.
It is none the less Italian. Though it were executed in
Germany, glazier and painter must have worked under the
direct influence of the Italian master, and in complete accord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
with him, putting at his service all their experience in their
craft, and all their skill. So well did they work together, that
it seems more likely that the executant not only worked under
the eye of the master, but was at his elbow whilst he designed.
That alone would account satisfactorily for the absolutely
harmonious co-operation of designer and glass-worker. One
thing is clear, that the artist, whatever his experience in glass,
great or little, had absolute sympathy with his new material,
felt what it could do, saw the opportunities it offered him, and
seized them.</p>

<p>An Englishman, or a Frenchman, who found himself for the
first time in Italy, would be puzzled to give a date to the
windows at Pisa or Milan, or in either of the churches of
S. Francis at Assisi. Even an expert in the glass of other
countries has to speak guardedly as to Italian work, or he may
have to retract his words. Italian Gothic is so Italian and so
little Gothic, it is of no use attempting to compare it with
Northern work. To those, moreover, who have been in the
habit of associating the Renaissance with the sixteenth century,
the forms of Quattro-Cento ornament will persist at first in
suggesting the later date&mdash;just as the first time one goes to
Germany the survival of the old form of lettering in inscriptions
throws a suspicion of lingering Gothic influence over even
full-blown Renaissance design. It takes some time to get over
the perplexity arising from the unaccustomed association of an
absolutely mosaic treatment of glass (which with us would
mean emphatically Gothic work) with distinctly Renaissance
detail, such as one finds at the churches already mentioned,
at the Certosa of Pavia, or at Florence.</p>

<p>At Assisi the glass means, for the most part, to be Gothic.
One is reminded there sometimes of German work, both by the
colour of the glass and by the design of some of the medallion
and other windows. The ornament generally inclines to the
naturalistic rather than to the Quattro-Cento arabesque, or to
the geometric kind shown on <a href="#Fig_53">page 96</a>; and though it includes
a fair amount of interlacing handwork of distinctly Italian
type, and is sometimes as deep in colour as quite Early glass,
it is approximately Decorated in character. That is so equally
with the brilliant remains in the tracery lights of Or San
Michele at Florence. But it is characteristic of Italian glass
of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries that, both by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
depth of its colour and the very quality of the material, it
should continually recall the thirteenth century. Sometimes,
as at Milan, for example, you find even sixteenth century glass
in which there is practically no white at all except what is used
for the flesh tint.</p>

<p>In the cathedral at Pisa are some windows with little
subjects, framed in ornament, all in richest and
most brilliant colour, which are at first sight
extremely perplexing. The leading is elaborately
minute, and there is no modelling in the figures,
which yet have nothing of archaic or very early
character. It turns out that the paint upon the
glass has perished, and there is hardly a vestige
of it left to show that this was not intended for
mere mosaic. The effect, nevertheless, is such
as to prove how much can be done in pot-metal
glass, and how little it depends upon the
painting on it.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 103px;">
<a id="Fig_177" name="Fig_177"></a>
<img src="images/fig_177.png" width="103" height="300" alt="Assisi" title="Assisi" />
<span class="caption">177. <span class="smcap">Assisi.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Elsewhere, as at Arezzo (in work earlier than
that of William of Marseilles), the paint has often
peeled off to a very considerable extent, revealing sometimes
patches of quite crude green and purple, which go to show
that the Italians habitually used glass of a raw colour, where
it suited their convenience, and just toned it down with brown
enamel. The result proves that it was a dangerous practice;
but, where the paint has held, the effect is not dull or dirty, as
with us it would be. The Italian sun accounts probably both
for the use of this scum of paint and for its not injuring the
effect of colour.</p>

<p>The same quality of deep rich pot-metal colour associated
with Renaissance design, is the first thing that strikes one in
the windows at Bologna, in the cathedral at Milan, and in
Florence everywhere. At Milan in particular there are compositions,
in which blue and red predominate, magnificently
rich and deep, in spite of recent cleaning. The cunning way
in which green is occasionally used to prevent any flowing
together of red and blue into purple, is a lesson in colour.
Two schemes of design prevail in the nave windows (the old
glass in the choir is so mixed up with new that it does not
count), both equally simple. In the one the rectangular
divisions formed by the mullions and the stouter bars are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
accepted, without further framing, as separate picture spaces;
in the other the main form of the window is taken as frame
to a single picture, the mullions being only so far taken into
account that the prominent figures are designed within them.
Some of these windows are late enough in the century to show
a falling off in treatment. In the Apostle window (attributed
to Michel Angelo?) the white glass is all reduced to a granular
tint of umber; and in the one illustrating the Life of the Virgin
there is a most aggressively foreshortened figure, which may
have been effective in the cartoon, but is absurd in the glass.
It is not, therefore, at Milan that typically Italian glass is best
to be studied, though there is enough of it to startle the student
of glass whose experience had not hitherto extended so far as
Italy. Neither is Italian glass at its best at Bologna, though
the city was noted for glass painting, which was practised there
by no less a person than the Blessed James of Ulm. But, truth
to tell, the best windows at Bologna (they are most of them
fairly good) are not those of the Saint but of Pellegrino Tibaldi
and Lorenzo Costa. It is at Florence that the distinctive quality
of Italian glass is best appreciated. There is a vast quantity
of it, varying in date from the early part of the fifteenth to the
latter part of the sixteenth century, but it is uniformly Italian,
and, with few exceptions, it is extremely good.</p>

<p>Figures under canopies are of common occurrence in Florentine
windows; but the canopies differ in several respects, both
from the ordinary Gothic canopy and from the shrine-like
structure of the later Renaissance. In the first place, the
canopy returns in Italy to its primitive dimensions. It may or
may not be architecturally interesting, but there is in no case
very much of it. The Italians never went canopy-mad; and
they kept the framework of their pictures within moderate
dimensions. The Italian canopy of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries, then, was just a niche, sometimes of Renaissance
design, sometimes affecting a more Gothic form with pointed
or cusped arch and so on, under which, or in front of which,
the figures stood. It bore definite relation to the figures, and
it was neither impossible of construction nor absurd in perspective.
Occasionally, in later work, as at the Certosa at Pavia,
it was delicate in colour, but, as a rule, it was strong and rich.
It was not merely that the shadowed portions were glazed in
pot-metal, as when, at Santa Croce, the coffered soffits of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
arches are one mosaic of jewellery, but that the canopy
throughout was in colour.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">178. <span class="smcap">S. Maria Novella, Florence.</span></span></p>

<p>That is the most striking characteristic of Italian canopy work,
and indeed of other ornamental setting&mdash;that it is as rich
as the picture, a part of it, not a frame to it. Constructionally,
of course, it is a frame; but the colour does away with the
effect of framework. It serves rather to connect the patches of
contrasting colour in the figures, than to separate one picture
from another. Occasionally this results in too much all-overishness,
more commonly it results in breadth, making you feel
that the window is one. It was explained what use was made
of white canopy work in Gothic glass, judiciously to break up
the surface of the window. In Italy the surface is
judiciously left unbroken, and in that case also the
result is most admirable.</p>

</div>

<p>With the exception of an occasional brassy yellow canopy, recalling
German colour, the same system of connecting canopy and subject together
by colour is adopted alike at S. Croce, at S. Maria Novella, and at the
Duomo at Florence. The composition of the windows is simple: within a
border of foliage or other ornament, two or three tiers of figures,
under modest canopies, separated perhaps by little medallions containing
busts or demi-figures. That occurs at S. Domenico, Perugia, as well as
at Florence.</p>

<p>A modification of the canopy occurs in the nave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
windows of the Duomo. The space within a narrow border
which frames the broad lancet, is divided into two by a strong
upright bar, and the divisions thus formed are treated as
separate trefoil-arched lancets, each with another border of its
own, the space above being treated much as though it were
tracery. (Something like this occurs, it will be remembered,
already in the thirteenth century, at Bourges.) In the tall
spaces within the borders are the usual tiers of figures under
canopies. Again, in the chapel of the Certosa in Val d&#8217;Ema,
near Florence, there is a window with double-niched canopies
and pronounced central shaft dividing the broad lancet into
two narrow ones.</p>

<p>The Italian canopy is not of so stereotyped a character as in
Decorated or Perpendicular design; and generally it may be
said that there is, both in the design and colour of Italian glass,
more variety than one finds out of Italy. The plan is less
obvious, the scheme less cut and dried; you know much less
what to expect than in Northern Gothic, and enjoy more often
the pleasure of surprise.</p>

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">180. <span class="smcap">S. Giovanni in Monte, Bologna.</span></span></p>

<p>Elaborately pictorial schemes of design are less common in
Italian glass than might have been expected. There is a
famous window in the church of SS. Giovanni e Paolo, at
Venice (1473), in which the four lights below the bands of
tracery which here takes the place of transom are given over
to subject. There green trees and pale blue water against
a deep blue sky and deeper blue hills, anticipate a favourite
sixteenth century colour scheme; but the glass is a mere wreck
of what was once probably a fine window.</p>

<p>Figure groups on a considerable scale are chiefly to be found
in the great &#8220;bull&#8217;s-eye&#8221; windows, which are a striking feature in
Italian Gothic churches, occupying a position where in France
would have been a rose&mdash;over the West door, for example.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">181. <span class="smcap">Arezzo.</span></span></p>

<p>These great circular windows, which occur at Arezzo, at
Bologna, at Siena, and especially at Florence, are usually
surrounded by an arabesque border. Occasionally the border
consists of a medley of cherubic wings and faces; occasionally,
as at Siena, it is in white, more in the form of mouldings; in
one case, at least, it disappears, as it were, behind the figure
group in the lower part of the window; but, as a rule, it consists
of Renaissance pattern, such as are shown here and on
<a href="#Fig_41">page 70</a>, large in scale, simple in design, and as mosaic in
execution as though it had been twelfth century work. The
centre of these circular lights may have, as at the Duomo at
Florence, a single upright figure, enthroned, occupying a sort
of tall central panel, supported by angels in the spandrils at the
sides; or it may have a subject running across it, as in the
case of Perino del Vaga&#8217;s &#8220;Last Supper&#8221; (1549) at the West
end of the cathedral at Siena. But very often it enclosed one
big figure subject, such as the &#8220;Descent from the Cross&#8221; at
Santa Croce, attributed to Ghiberti. An earlier manner of
occupying a bull&#8217;s-eye is shown in the East window at Siena,
dating probably from about the beginning of the fourteenth
century. This is subdivided by four huge cross bars (two
horizontal and two vertical) into nine compartments, or a cross
consisting of one central square, four squarish arms, and four
triangular spandrils. Each of these divisions is taken as
though it were a separate light, and has its own border,
enclosing a separate subject. The bars, it is true, are of great
size, wide enough almost to have been of stone; but the
scheme rather suggests that the designer was not quite aware,
when he designed it, how much less significant they would
appear in the glass than they did in his drawing.</p>

<p>Unquestionably the finest windows in Florence are the great
lancets in the apse and south apsidal transept of the Duomo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
finer than the three lights at the East end of S. Maria Novella,
which are so much more often spoken of, possibly because
they are seen to so much more advantage in the dark-walled
Lady Chapel. It is difficult to trace in these Duomo windows
the hand of Ghiberti or Donatello (1434), their reputed
designers. They are planned on the simplest lines. In the
upper series, the space within a narrowish border is divided,
by a band of ornament or inscription, into two fairly equal
parts, in each of which stand two figures facing one another
(<a href="#Fig_182">opposite</a>) under the simplest form of canopy, if canopy it can
be called. It is a mere frame, at the back of which is a two-arched
arcade, with shafts disappearing behind the figures.
They stand, that is to say, not under but in front of it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 312px;">
<a id="Fig_182" name="Fig_182"></a>
<img src="images/fig_182.png" width="312" height="500" alt="Figures" title="Figures" />
</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">182. <span class="smcap">Figures, Duomo, Florence.</span></span></p>

<p>In the lower series the arrangement is the same, except that
the upper compartment contains a single figure, larger in scale,
and seated, under a canopy of rather more architectural pretensions.
Some of the canopies have cusped arches, and
some of the borders are foliated in a more or less Gothic
way; but obviously the Gothicism throughout is only in
deference to prevailing fashion. In feeling and effect the
work is Renaissance.</p>

<p>The design here given shows about one half of a window;
but it gives, unfortunately, no hint of the colour. The depth
of it may be imagined when it is told that the only approach to
white in it is in the beaded line round the nimbus of the figure
to the right, and that is of the horniest character. The flesh is
of a rich brownish tint.</p>

<p>The head on <a href="#Fig_183">page 270</a> goes nearer to suggesting colour.
There again the face is brown, the hair and beard dark and
bluish; against it the band round the head, which is ruby,
tells light. The orange-yellow nimbus, rayed, is rather lighter
still, the beaded fillet edging it bone-white. The drapery is of
brightest yellow diapered with occasional blue trefoils, each of
which has in its centre a touch of red. The background is of
very dark blue, the architecture nearest it bright green, beyond
that it is dark red.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 229px;">

<img src="images/fig_183.png" width="229" height="250" alt="Florence" title="Florence" />
<span class="caption">183. <span class="smcap">Florence.</span></span>
</div>

<p>This short explanation will serve to indicate the key in which
the colour is pitched. The glass itself, it has been said, is as rich
as French work of the twelfth century, as deep as German of the
fourteenth, but more vivid than either; there are no low-toned
greens or inky blues. The blue is sapphire, the green has the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a><br /><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>quality of an emerald. In this palette of pure colour the artist
revelled. Nowhere as in the Duomo at Florence is one so impressed with
the feeling that the designer was dealing deliberately always with
colour. Plainly that, and no other, was his impulse, colour&mdash;broad,
large, beautiful, impressive, solemn colour masses. Elsewhere the
story-teller speaks, or the draughtsman, here the colourist confesses
himself. The grand scale of his figures allows him to treat his colour
largely, and its breadth is no less notable than its brilliancy. There
is infinite variety in it; but the general impression is of great masses
of red, blue, yellow, green, purple, brown, and so on, held together by
the same colours distributed in smaller threads and spots, as in diapers
on drapery. The broad mass of any one colour is itself made up of many
various tints of glass. The accidental fusion of colour, as of red and
blue into purple, is guarded against by framing, say, the blue with
green, or the ruby with brownish-yellow. At other times neutral tones
are deliberately produced by the combination of, for example, red and
green lines.</p>

<p>The event proves that in this way, and by the choice of
deep rather than low tones, not only mellowness but sobriety
of colour is to be obtained. The artist would certainly have
chosen rather to be crude than dull; but it is very rarely that
a false note occurs, and then most likely it is due to the decay
of the brown paint upon which he relied to bring it into tone.</p>

<p>At Arezzo one was disposed to think nothing could be finer
than the glass of William of Marseilles; at Florence one is
quite certain that nothing could be more beautiful than the glass
in the Duomo. Each is, after its kind, perfect. But at Florence,
at all events (<i>les absents ont toujours tort</i>), one finds that this is
not only the more decorative kind, but the more dignified. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
is disposed to ask, whether it is not better that in glass there
should be no deceptive pictures, no perspective to speak of,
only simple and severely disposed figures, which never in any
way disturb the architectural effect, which give to the least
attractive interior&mdash;the Duomo is as bare as a barn and as drab
as a meeting-house&mdash;something of architectural dignity.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<br />
TRACERY LIGHTS AND ROSE WINDOWS.</h3>

<p>Glass in tracery lights and Rose windows cannot consistently
be planned on the lines suitable to lancets or other upright
shapes; and it is interesting to observe the modifications of
design necessitated by its adaptation to circumstances so
different. This applies not only to Gothic glass but to
Renaissance, the best of which, as it happens, is in Gothic
windows. Happily it never occurred to sixteenth century
artists to hamper themselves by any affectation of archaism,
and their work is deliberately in the new manner. One can
understand, too, a certain &#8220;up-to-date&#8221; contempt on their
part for the &#8220;old-fashioned&#8221; stonework; but it is rather
surprising that so few of them seem to have realised how
greatly their own work would have gained by a little more
consideration of (if not for) the stonework.</p>

<p>Where, as at Gouda, by way of exception, Gothic windows
were built to receive later glass, tracery is to all intents and
purposes abandoned: the builders would have done away with
mullions had they known how otherwise to support such huge
glass pictures. It has been explained already, in reference
to the influence of the window-shape, and especially of the
mullions, upon glass design, how much more formidable these
divisions appear upon paper than in the window. That is very
plainly seen in many a window where the designer has relied
upon them to frame his subjects. The pictures have a way of
running together in the most perplexing way, and one has to
pick them out for oneself again. The practical conclusion
from that is, that the designer is under no obligation to confine
himself too strictly within the separate lights of a large window.
What he is bound to do is to take care that the mullions never
hurt his picture; if they do, it is his picture which is to blame.
He may urge with reason that the upright shafts of stone are
there merely for the support of the window, and that it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
his business to emphasise them, enough if he acknowledge
them. In tracery, however, it is his bounden duty to take
much more heed of the stonework. It was designed, in intricate
and often very beautiful lines, with deliberately ornamental
intent; it was meant to be seen, and it is his function
to show it off. The question he has to put to himself is
now no longer: does the stonework hurt my design? but: does
my design hurt the stonework? And he should not be satisfied
unless it helps it. The artist who, at Bourges, having <i>fleur-de-lys</i>-shaped
tracery to deal with, carried across it a design
quite contrary to the lines of the stonework, was guilty of a
blank absurdity.</p>

<p>The Early Rose windows, which were habitually filled with
rich coloured glass, consisted either of simple piercings, as at
Lincoln, or they were made up of piercings very definitely
divided by massive stonework. In proportion as mullions
become narrow, and form in themselves a design, it seems
doubtful how far deep-coloured glass can do them justice. Only
strong tracery lines will stand strong colour. At Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne,
for example, the foils of certain cusped lights surrounding
a central circular picture are successfully ornamented with
arabesque of deep yellow upon paler yellow ground; and again
at Or San Michele, Florence, certain gorgeous wheels of ruby
and yellow, or of blue, green, and yellow, and so on, are
unusually satisfactory. In such cases not only breadth of effect
but definition of the tracery forms is gained by keeping them
(more especially in their outer circumference) much of one
tone, whilst contrast of colour between one light and another
helps still further to assist definition. But this applies only to
stonework strong enough to take care of itself. There is a sort
of perverse brutality in putting into delicate and graceful
tracery deep rich glass which hides its lines. Such lines want
sharply defining against the light.</p>

<p>Early windows had, of course, no tracery properly so called.
The great Rose windows, and the smaller Roses surmounting
a pair of lancets, were rather piercings than tracery; and it
was not difficult to adapt the design of a medallion window
to suit them. A small piercing was ready designed for a
medallion subject; nothing was wanted but a border round it,
narrower, of course, than would have been used for a broad
lancet light, but of the same foliated character. The individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
quatrefoils or other principal openings, which went to make
up a great Rose window, were filled in the same way. If the
opening were wedge-shaped, as it often was, the obvious thing
to do was to introduce into it a medallion (probably circular)
of the full width of the opening, at about its widest, and
to fill up the space about it with foliated ornament or geometric
mosaic, with which also the smaller and less important
piercings would naturally be filled. Sometimes the recurring
figure medallions were set alternately in foliated ornament and
geometric diaper; or the lights might be grouped in pairs, two
with foliage and two with diaper. Similar alternation of the
two common kinds of Early filling, naturally occurred in minor
openings which contained no medallion. Something of this
kind occurs at Reims.</p>

<p>When the shape of the great Rose permitted it&mdash;if, that is
to say, the circular outline was strongly pronounced&mdash;it was
possibly further acknowledged by a fairly broad border, following
it and disappearing, as it were, behind the stonework;
otherwise, except in the case of smaller medallion-shaped
openings, it was not usual to mark them by even so much as
a border line. Small Roses had sometimes, as at Auxerre, a
central figure medallion round which were secondary foliage
medallions set in diaper. A certain waywardness of design,
already remarked in medallion windows, was sometimes shown
by filling the central medallion with ornament and grouping
the pictures round it.</p>

<p>As the lights of a Rose window radiated from the centre,
features which recurred throughout the series arranged themselves
inevitably in rings; and according to the disposition of the
emphatic features of the design, the rays or the rings pronounced
themselves. This is partly the affair of the architect who sets
out the stonework, but it lies with the glazier whether he
choose to subdue or to emphasise either feature. It is hard to
say why one or other of these schemes of glass design, in rays
or in rings, should be preferred; but, as a matter of experience,
the sun and star patterns are not among the most happy.
Perhaps the stone spokes of a wheel window assert themselves
quite enough any way, and the eye wants leading, not vaguely
away from the centre, but definitely round the window.</p>

<p>The circular belts of pattern formed by medallions or other
features answer to, and fulfil the part of, the horizontal bands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
in upright windows (<a href="#Page_153">page 153</a>), and bind the lights together.
The band has it all its own way in a mere &#8220;bull&#8217;s-eye,&#8221; such as
you find in Italy, where there are no radiating lines of masonry.
It is strongly pronounced in some circular medallion windows
at Assisi, in which an extraordinarily wide border (a quarter
of their diameter in width) is divided into eight equal panels,
each enclosed in its own series of border lines, within which
is a medallion set in foliated ornament. This is fourteenth
century work; but, as in thirteenth century Roses, the bars
follow and accentuate the main divisions of the window.</p>

<p>Even when it came to the glazing of a Rose window in a
later Gothic style, it is not uncommon to find a series or two
of medallions running round the window, as occurs at Angers.
They hold the design together; but in the nature of the case
they are on too small a scale for the pictures to count for more
than broken colour. Indeed you may see here the relative
value in such a position of small figure subjects and bold ornament.
The scrollwork is as effective as the medallions are
insignificant. In fact, compared to them, the illegible medallion
subjects in the lancet lights below are readable by him who
runs. It has to be confessed that quite some of the most
beautiful and impressive Rose windows are perfectly unintelligible,
even with a good field-glass. This is so with the
West Rose at Reims. In the centre it is ablaze with red and
orange, towards the rim it shades off into deliciously cool
greens and greenish-yellows. It may mean what it may;
the colour is enough.</p>

<p>Room for figure work on an intelligible scale is only to
be found by a device which verges on the ridiculous. In the
beautiful North Rose at S. Ouen, Rouen, figures which should
be upright are arranged in a circle like herrings in a barrel.
Similar figures on a smaller scale occur in certain tracery
lights at Lincoln, two of which are here given. Again in the
North Rose at Le Mans there are twenty-four radiating figures.
In fact, they were customarily so arranged, even down to the
sixteenth century, a period at which one does not credit the
designer with medi√¶val artlessness.</p>

<p>It is obvious that out of a series of twenty or more figures,
radiating like the spokes of a wheel, only a very few can stand
anything like upright. The designer of the South Rose at
S. Ouen has endeavoured to get over the difficulty, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
to accommodate his design to the exceeding narrowness of the lights as
they approach their axis, by giving his personages no legs, and making
them issue from a kind of sheath or bouquet-holder. A number of the
figures pretending to stand in the radiating lights by a Rose or wheel
window must be ridiculously placed. And then there occurs the question
as to whether they shall all stand with their feet towards the hub.
Where the figures have space to float, it is different. The angels in
the Late Gothic Rose window at Angers, with swirling drapery which hides
their feet, and makes them by so much the less obviously human, if not
more actually angelic, solve the difficulty of full-length figures (on
any appreciable scale) in the only possible way.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">

<span class="caption">185. <span class="smcap">Two Lights of a Rose Window, Lincoln.</span></span>
</div>

<p>A portion of a simple and rather striking wheel window of
the Decorated period, in which concentric bands of ornament
form a conspicuous feature, is shown <a href="#Fig_186">overleaf</a>. In the small
Rose from Assisi (<a href="#Page_278">page 278</a>) the glazier has very successfully
supplemented the design of the architect, completing the four
circles, and accentuating them further by glazing the central
spandrils in much darker colour than the rest of the glass,
which is mainly white.</p>

<p>In the elaborate tracery of the Decorated or geometric period
the mullions, as was said, ask to be pronounced. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
usually done in the Second Gothic period by framing each light
with a border, separated from the stonework always by a
fillet of white glass. The exception to this was in the case
of trefoiled or other many-foiled openings, in which a central
medallion or boss, usually circular, extended to the points of
the cusps, and the border round the cuspings stopped short
against the border to that. Or again in triangular openings
a central boss would sometimes extend to its margin, and the
borders would stop against that, or pass seemingly behind it.</p>

<p>A typical form of Decorated tracery occurs in the West window at York
Minster, by far the most beautiful part of it. There, every important
opening has within its white marginal line a broader band of ruby or
green, broken at intervals by yellow spots, within which border is
foliage of white and yellow on a green or ruby ground. Some of the
smaller openings show white and yellow foliage only, without any
coloured ground. A plan equally characteristic of the period is
illustrated at Tewkesbury. There again occurs similar white foliage, its
stem encircling a central spot of yellow. This also is on green and ruby
backgrounds, the former reserved for the more prominent openings; but
the border is in white, painted with a pattern. This broader white
border more effectively relieves the dark lines of the masonry than the
border of colour, which sometimes confuses the shapes of the smaller
tracery openings: it does so, for example, in the Late glass on <a href="#Fig_151">page
200</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>For what was said of the difficulty of carrying a broad border
round the heads of Decorated lights applies more forcibly still
to tracery. The merest fillet of colour is often as much as
can safely be carried round the opening, if even that. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
other hand, a broad border of white and stain, even though it contain a
fair amount of black in it, may safely be used&mdash;as at Ch√¢lons,
where it frames small subjects in rich colour. Some admirable Decorated
tracery occurs at Wells, much on the usual lines, and containing a good
deal of pleasant green; but there the white and yellow foliage in the
centre part of the lights is sometimes so closely designed that very
little of the coloured ground shows through it, and it looks at first as
if what little ground there is had all been painted-out. At S. Denis
Walmgate, York, the background to the foliage in white and yellow (which
last predominates) is painted solid: the only pot-metal colour (except
in the central medallion head) is in a rosette or two of colour leaded
into it; the border is white. Another expedient there employed is to
introduce figures in white and stain upon a ground of green or ruby,
diapered. At Wells there occur little figures of saints in pot-metal
colour, planted upon the white foliated filling of the tracery lights.
Decorated circular medallions occupying the centre of ornamental tracery
lights are usually framed in coloured lines; occasionally the inner
margin of the medallion is cusped, in imitation of stonework.</p>

<span class="caption">187. <span class="smcap">Assisi.</span></span>
</div>

<p>An effective plan, adopted at Evreux, is to gather the lights
into groups, by means of the colour introduced into them,
which grouping may or may not be indicated by the stonework.
In any case, it is a means of obtaining at once variety and
breadth of colour.</p>

<p>Perpendicular tracery lights are themselves, in most cases,
only copies in miniature of the larger lights below, and the
glass is designed on the same plan. A good illustration of this
is at Great Malvern, where the design consists of the orthodox
canopy work in white and stain, with little figures also nearly
all in white, colour occurring only in the lower skirts of their
drapery, in the background about their heads, and behind the
pinnacles above. The effect is beautifully silvery. Often such
figures under the canopies are angels, all in white and stain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
Sometimes seraphim, in stain upon a white ground, quarried
perhaps, fill the lights, without canopies. These are all typical
ways of filling the tracery of a Perpendicular window.</p>

<p>It was quite a common thing to fill it with glass wholly of
white and stain. In the centre there might be a medallion head
in grisaille, or an inscribed label, the rest of the space being
occupied by conventional foliage having just a line of clear
white next the stonework. Beautiful examples of this treatment
occur at Great Malvern; occasionally the foliage is all in yellow
with white flowers. Small openings are thus often glazed in a
single piece of glass, or in any case with the fewest possible
leads. At S. Serge, Angers, there is larger work of a similar
kind, a bold scroll in white and stain on a ground of solid
pigment, out of which is scratched a smaller pattern, not so
bold as in the least to interfere with the scroll, but enough to
prevent anything like heaviness in the painted ground. Similar
treatment is adopted in the cathedral at Beauvais. Once in a
while one comes, in English work, upon figures in white and
stain on a solid black ground extending to the stonework,
without any line of white to show where the glass ends and the
stonework begins. It would be impossible more emphatically
than that to show one&#8217;s contempt for the architecture.</p>

<p>Some disregard, if not actually contempt, is shown for architecture
in the practice, common no less in Late Gothic than in
Renaissance design, of carrying a coloured ground right up to
the stone, without so much as a line of light to separate the
two. Comparatively light though the colour may be, it is
usually dark enough, unless it be yellow, to confuse the forms
of any but the boldest tracery. Something of the kind occurred
by way of exception even in fourteenth century glass, as at
S. Radegonde, Poitiers, and at Toulouse, where the tracery
of the windows is one field of blue, irregularly sprinkled with
white stars. The lines of the tracery are lost, and one sees
only spots of white.</p>

<p>The Later Gothic plan was to keep tracery light, even though
the window below it were altogether in rich colour, and the
effect was good; as at Alen√ßon, where a distinctly blue window
has in the tracery only angels in white and yellow on a white
ground; or, again, at Conches, where white-robed angels, on
a ground of rich stain, contrast pleasantly with the cool blue
of the lights below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
Unusual treatment of the tracery occurs at Auch (1513). In the main the
tracery lights contain figures in colour upon a ruby or paler-coloured
ground, which, as in so many a Renaissance window, runs out to the
stonework; but occasionally here and there a light is distinguished by a
border of white. Moreover, the ground is, as a rule, not of one colour
throughout, nor even throughout a single light, but varied; and that not
symmetrically or pattern-wise, but so as artfully to carry the colour
through. In fact, the artist has taken his tracery much more seriously
than usual, and has carefully studied how best he could balance by the
colour in it the not quite so easily-to-be-controlled colour of his
figure composition below. The result is that the windows are all of one
piece&mdash;each a complete and well-considered colour composition: the
tracery is not merely the top part of the frame to the coloured picture
below.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 227px;">

<span class="caption">188. <span class="smcap">Lyons.</span></span>
</div>

<p>In Renaissance glass the tracery was more often in comparatively full
colour, even though the lights below were pale. A grisaille window at
Evreux, with practically blue tracery, has a very pleasant effect.</p>

<p>It was not often that the Renaissance glass painters gave
very serious attention to the tracery which they had to fill.
They were, for the most part, content to conceive each separate
opening as a blue field upon which to place an angel (as <a href="#Fig_188">above</a>),
a crown, a <i>fleur-de-lys</i>, or other emblem, as best might fit. In
very many sixteenth century windows the design consists merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
of angels, emblems, labels, or even clouds, dotted about, as
suited the convenience of the designer. Sometimes, as at
S. Alpin, at Troyes, there occurs in a tracery light a tablet
bearing a date,&mdash;presumably, but not always positively, that of
the window. Such devices were very often in white upon a
ground of blue, purple, or ruby. Angels of course adapted
themselves to irregular shapes in the most angelic way; and
they are introduced in every conceivable attitude&mdash;standing,
kneeling, flying, swinging censers, singing, playing on musical
instruments, bearing scrolls or shields; angels all in white,
angels in white with coloured wings, angels in gorgeous array
of colour: and more accommodating, still, is the bodiless
cherub, beloved of Luca della Robbia.</p>

<p>There is a quite charming effect of colour in a Jesse window
at S. Maclou, Rouen, where the tracery lights are inhabited by
little cherubs, in ruby on a grey-blue ground, in grey on deeper
grey-blue, and in emerald-like green upon the same.</p>

<p>The scroll without the angel was a very convenient filling for
smaller openings. Some elaborately twisted scrolls, in white
and stain on purple, occur at Moulins.</p>

<p>Larger and more prominent lights often contain a separate
picture, or one picture runs through several lights, or perhaps
all through the tracery. Worse than that is, where the picture
runs through from the lights below; as at Alen√ßon, where the
trees grow up into the blue of the tracery, broken otherwise
only by white clouds; or at Conches, where the architecture
from the subject below aspires so high. It is almost worse
still where, as at Alen√ßon again, and at the chapel at Vincennes,
it is the canopy which so encroaches. In the exceptional case
of a Jesse window there seems less objection to accepting the
whole window as a field through which the tree may grow;
yet the tracery is not the happiest part of the Beauvais window
(<a href="#Fig_247">page 368</a>). Sometimes the heads of the lower lights are made
to appear as though they were part of the tracery.</p>

<p>A happier form of Renaissance tracery design is where
medallion heads in white and stain are introduced upon a
ground of plain colour&mdash;blue at Ch√¢lons, purple-brown at
Montmorency. These are sometimes most beautifully painted,
as are the Raffaellesque little cherubs amidst white clouds,
also at Montmorency; but they are much more delicately done
than they need have been, and less effective than they might.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
Very delicate painting upon white does produce an effect even
at a distance; at least it gives quality; but there should be
some relation between effort and effect; and here the effect is
weak as compared with the expenditure of art. In the tracery
on <a href="#Fig_158">page 213</a>, fairly effective though monotonous, the birds are
glazed in with such unnecessary avoidance of lead, that the
cutting of the ground must have been a work of great difficulty.
In glass of every period it has been the custom to
put too much into tracery; in Early work too much detail,
in Later too much finish. What is wanted is breadth.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<br />
QUARRY WINDOWS.</h3>

<p>The very simplest form of window glazing, the easiest and the
thriftiest thing for the cutter to do, and the most straightforward
for the glazier, is to frame together parallel-sided
pieces of glass in the form of a lead lattice.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 243px;">

<span class="caption">189. <span class="smcap">Lincoln.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Quarries, as all such little square or rhomboid shaped panes
of glass came to be called, were used from the first. Ordinarily
they were set on end, so as to form diamonds; which as time
went on, were generally not rectangular, but long in proportion
to their breadth.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 223px;">
<a id="Fig_190" name="Fig_190"></a>

</div>

<p>For the most part they were painted with patterns traced
in brown; and, on the discovery of silver stain, they were in
parts tinted yellow. From the fourteenth century onwards,
quarry lights, framed in borders, and enlivened with colour,
form a very important variety of grisaille.</p>

<p>Many a grisaille pattern was not far removed from quarry
glazing, as may be seen <a href="#Fig_189">opposite</a>. It was natural that, for
clerestory and triforium windows in particular, the glazier
should do all he could to simplify his work. Clerestory
windows are placed too high to be fairly seen in a narrow
church, and triforium lights are often half shut off from view
by projecting shafts of open arcading in front of them. It is
only when, by rare chance, they happen to front you squarely
at the end of an aisle or transept, that they are properly seen.
There is no occasion, therefore, to indulge in subtleties of
design; the one thing needful is that the effect of the windows
as a whole, should be pleasant, since all study of detail is out
of the question, except from the triforium galleries opposite, or
by the aid of a field-glass; and light arrangements of grisaille
and colour are in most cases all that is wanted. The colour
may be more or less, according as it is desired to exclude light
or to admit it; but some very simple, unpretending, and perhaps
even rude treatment, is indicated by the conditions of
the case, which to contradict, is wasteful and unworkmanlike.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
The effect, for example, of the band of figures across the grisaille in
the triforium of the transepts at Evreux is admirable; but the way in
which seven saints out of the eight are cut vertically in two by the
pillars of the architectural screen in front of them, is nothing less
than exasperating. These figures tell only as the patches of colour; and
that could so easily have been obtained by much simpler means. In such a
position, quarries may well take the place, not only of figures, but of
more interesting grisaille; and, even though they be not painted at all
(as is again the case at Evreux), but merely broken by occasional
sun-discs in white and stain crossing them, and framed in a simple block
border of white and colour, the effect may be entirely adequate. It is
not meant to deny that figures in rich colour embedded in carefully
designed grisaille are more attractive; but, for its purpose, quarry
work, with borders and bosses of colour, is in the majority of such
cases, enough.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 245px;">

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">191.  <span class="smcap">Quarry Window, Evreux.</span></span></p>

<p>Figures or figure subjects in formal bands across tall quarry lights are
always effective; so are figures planted more casually upon the
quarries&mdash;kneeling donors, flying angels, or whatever they may be.
So again, are figure panels alternating with bosses of ornament; but, if
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> window occupy a position where the figures can be
appreciated, a surrounding of quarries seems hardly of interest enough,
and if not, the figures seem rather thrown away. One is tempted to make
exception in favour of figures in grisaille, which, if very delicately
painted (as for example at S. Martin-cum-Gregory, York), show to
advantage on a quarry ground, which has the modesty not to compete with
them in interest. The quarries keep their place perfectly as a
background; and the slight painting upon them is just enough to give the
glass quality, and to indicate that, however subordinate, it is yet part
of the picture.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 141px;">

</div>

<p>A quarry window, no less than any other, wants a border,
if only to prevent the strongly marked straight lines of lead
from appearing to run into the stone work. A simple line
of colour with another of white next the mullions is enough
for that. Even this is occasionally omitted, more especially in
tracery lights, but in that case the glass seems to lack finish.
The most satisfactory border to quarry lights into which otherwise
no colour is introduced, is a broadish border of white,
painted with pattern and in part stained. A coloured border
seems to imply other colour breaking the field of quarries. By
itself it is too much or not enough. Its proportion is a thing
to be determined in each case on the spot; but even in narrow
lights, if they contain bosses of colour (as do those in the
transepts at Le Mans) a broad border about one fifth the
width of the window, with a broad white line next the stone,
is very effective.</p>

</div>

<p>The monotony of any great surface of quarry work, has led
to the introduction of medallions and the like, even where it
is not desired to introduce pot-metal colour. In the window
from Evreux, illustrated <a href="#Fig_191">opposite</a>, the effect of the delicately
painted little angel medallions, in white on a ground of stain,
is all that could be wished. Any little surprise of that kind is
always welcome; but, should it occur too frequently, it becomes
itself monotonous.</p>

<span class="caption">194. <span class="smcap">Early English Quarry.</span></span>
</div>

<p>There is no end to the variety of forms in which colour
may be introduced into quarry work. It is best in the form
of patches, and not in the form of lines between the quarries
as occurs occasionally, at Poitiers, for example, at Rouen
cathedral, and at Ch√¢lons (<a href="#Page_167">page 167</a>).</p>

<p>Big rosettes, discs, wreaths, rings of colour, and the like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a><br />
<a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>, are more
effective than small spots. They need not be heavy, there may be any
amount of white in them. In narrow lights, they may sometimes with
advantage come in front of the border; that admits of the biggest
possible medallion, and it is best to have such features large and few.
Mean little rosettes are too suggestive of the contractor; in the church
of S. Ouen, at Rouen, one is uncomfortably reminded of him&mdash;it
would be so easy to estimate for glass of that kind at so much the foot!
Heraldic shields form often peculiarly effective colour-patches in
quarry windows, more especially because of the accidental arrangement of
colour they compel. There is a point at which symmetry of colour palls
upon the eye.</p>

<p>The even surface of quarry lights all in white and stain is broken
sometimes by an occasional band of inscription, which may either take
the line of the quarries, or cross them in the form of a label. At
Evreux some quarry lights are most pleasingly interrupted by square
patches of inscription in yellow, or, which is still more satisfactory,
in white. In the same cathedral there is a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
interesting instance of inscription, in letters some five or six inches
high, leaded in blue upon a quarry ground.</p>

<p>The patterns with which quarries are painted naturally followed the
ordinary course of grisaille. In the thirteenth century the designs were
strongly outlined, and showed clear against a cross-hatched ground;
which, however, did not, as a rule, extend to the lead, but a margin of
clear glass was left next to it, in acknowledgment of the quarry shape.
The combination of quarries and strap ornament in the example at Lincoln
(<a href="#Fig_192">page 287</a>) is unusual, but the quarries themselves are, but for the
absence of a clear line next the leads, characteristically of the
thirteenth century. The quarry border from Nuremberg (<a href="#Fig_193">above</a>) is rather
later in character. In that case also, as it happens, there is no
marginal line of clear glass. The typical treatment is shown <a href="#Fig_194">below</a>.
Later, as in other grisaille, the cross-hatched ground was omitted; and
the foliage took, of course, more natural form. It was presently more
delicately traced (<a href="#Fig_196">page 290</a>), and more often than not tinted in yellow
stain. Consistently with the more natural form of leafage the design in
fourteenth century work was often one continuous growth trailing through
the window, and passing behind the marginal band of stain which now
usually emphasised the top sides of the quarries. Often a futile attempt
was made (<a href="#Fig_191">page 286</a>) to give the appearance of interlacing to these
bands, but that was nullified by the stronger lead lines. True,
interlacing was only possible where, as in some earlier work, the bands
were continued on all four sides of the quarry, so that the lead fell
into its place <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a><br /><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>as interspace between two interlacing
bands. It was better when there was no pretence of interlacing (<a href="#Fig_197">below</a>).
Additional importance was sometimes given to the marginal band by
tracing a pattern upon it, or, as on <a href="#Fig_198">page 291,</a>, painting it in brown, and
then picking out geometric tracery upon it. There came a time when
marginal lines were omitted altogether. That was the usual, though not
invariable, practice in the fifteenth century, by which time the
draughtsman had apparently learnt to husband his inventive faculty. The
continuous growth of the pattern, as well as the marginal acknowledgment
of the lead lines, died out of fashion, and quarries were mostly painted
sprig fashion. The character of these sprigs will be best judged from
the specimens on <a href="#Fig_195">page 289</a>, some of the most interesting given in &#8220;Shaw&#8217;s
Book of Quarries.&#8221; Quarry patterns do not, of course, occur in that
profuse variety; it is seldom that more than two patterns are found in a
single window, often there is only one. The range of design in quarries
of this kind is limited only by the invention of the artist. It includes
both floral and conventional ornament, animal and grotesque figures,
emblems and heraldic badges, cyphers, monograms, mottoes, and so on.
There is scope not only for meaning in design, but for the artist&#8217;s
humour;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span> but, when all is said, the Late Gothic pattern windows,
now given over entirely to quarry work, are of no great account as
concerns their detail. The later quarry patterns are often pretty
enough, sometimes amusing, but they go for very little in the decoration
of a church. Plentiful as quarry work is everywhere, and characteristic
as it is of Perpendicular glass, there is not much that shows an attempt
to do anything serious with the quarry window. All that was done was to
paint more or less delicate and dainty patterns upon the little lozenge
panes. However, they were traced with a light hand and a sure one, and
with a kind of spontaneity which gives them really what artistic charm
they have.</p>

<p>The occasional endeavours to get stronger and bolder effects in quarry
work were not very successful. At Evreux and at Rouen there are some
late quarries painted more after the fashion of bold mosaic diaper; but
the effect, though satisfactory enough, is not such as to convince one
that that is the better way.</p>

<p>To heraldry, and especially to shields of arms surrounded by mantling
(<a href="#Fig_200">page 293</a>), quarries form an excellent background, but only in the event
of there being enough of them left free to show that it is a quarry
window upon which the heraldry is imposed, or rather into which it is
inlaid. Odds and ends of quarries want to be accounted for, as forming
the continuation of the glass above and below. In the case of a window
not a quarry window, it is a mistake to break up the background, as was
sometimes done, into quarries, or rather into fragments of quarries. The
object of the square or diamond shape is to break up a plain surface. If
the ground is naturally broken up by figures, foliage, mantling, or what
not, why introduce further quarry lines? They are not in themselves
interesting. Their great value is in that they give scale to a window;
but that is only on condition that they are seen in their entirety.</p>

<p>In Germany the place of quarries was supplied by roundels
(<a href="#Fig_199">page 292</a>) unpainted. What applies to quarries applies in
many respects to them; and they have a brilliancy which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a><br /><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>flat glass has not. They were usually enclosed in painted
borders of white and stain, and have a very delicate and pearly
effect; but where (as at S. Peter&#8217;s, at Cologne) they occur in
great quantity as compared with coloured subjects, these appear
to be floating rather uncomfortably in their midst. The Italians,
who also used roundels in place of quarries, often let colour into
the interstices between them, and also little painted squares or
pater√¶ of white and stain. In the sham windows decorating the
Sistine Chapel at Rome, separating Botticelli&#8217;s series of Popes,
the pointed spaces between the rounds are coloured diagonally
in successive rows of red, yellow, and green; but the result
is most pleasing where, as at Verona and elsewhere, the little
triangular spaces are neither of one tint nor yet symmetrically
arranged, but distributed in a quasi-accidental and unexpected
way. Sometimes it was the little pater√¶ that was in colour and
the rest white. In any case, the effect is refined, as it is at
Arezzo also, where the monotony of roundels, in sundry clerestory
windows, is broken by figure medallions and other features<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
in white and colour. The adaptation of roundels to the circular
shape is shown in the portion of a round window from
Santa Maria Novella. What more remains to be said about
roundels and quarry windows is reserved for the chapter on

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<br />
DOMESTIC GLASS.</h3>

<p>It is customary to draw a distinction between &#8220;Ecclesiastical&#8221;
and &#8220;Domestic&#8221; glass.</p>

<p>In medi√¶val days the Church was the patron of art; and,
when kings and corporations commissioned stained glass
windows, it was usually to present them to Mother Church.
It is in churches, then, that the greater part of the old glass
remains to us, iconoclastic mania notwithstanding; and it is
only there that the course of glass painting can be traced.
Once in a while, as at S. Mary&#8217;s Hall, Coventry, one comes
upon a great window designed to decorate a civic building;
but the whiles are few and far between. When such windows
do occur they prove not to differ widely from more familiar
church work.</p>

<p>What, then, is the difference between the two kinds of glass?
It is not that the one is ecclesiastical the other secular, the
one religious the other profane art. &#8220;Sacred Art&#8221; is a term
consecrated by use; but, strictly speaking, it is a meaningless
combination of words, signifying, if it signify anything, that the
speaker confounds the art of telling with the thing told. Art
has no more a religion than it has a country. No doubt there
clings always to the art of the devout believer some fervour of
faith, as there may hang about the sceptic&#8217;s doing a chill of
doubt. The historian will enrich his glass with story, the
preacher will convey in it a dogma. Poet or proser, philosopher
or fool, may each in turn peep out of the window. Youth will
everywhere betray its ardour, manhood its vigour, age its
experience. A live man cannot help but put himself into his
work. But none of that is art. His art is in the way he
expresses himself, not in what he says; and there is no more
religion in his glass painting than in his handwriting, though
the graphologist may read in it his character.</p>

<p>The difference between church glass and domestic arises,
speaking from the point of view of art, solely from architectural
conditions.  In so far as they are both glass, the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
methods of glazing and painting apply to both. It is only in
so far as the position and purpose of the two are different,
that they call for different treatment in design. The treatment
suitable to a great hall does not materially differ from that
adapted to a church; the same breadth of design, the same
largeness of execution, are required; what suits a cloister
would suit a passage. When, however, it comes to the
windows of dwelling-rooms, the scheme and execution appropriate
even to the smallest chapels of a church, would most
likely be out of place. The distinction is very much as that
between wall decoration in fresco and cabinet paintings in
oil- or water-colour.</p>

<p>In the house there is less need than in the church for severity,
and more for liveliness, less occasion for breadth, and more
for delicacy. The scale of the dwelling-room itself justifies,
perhaps demands, a smaller treatment. Here, if anywhere, is
opportunity for that preciousness of execution which, in work
of more monumental character, it seems a pity to expend upon
so frail a substance as glass&mdash;frailer than ever when it was the
thin white glass employed for window panes. For, so far from
the glazier of the sixteenth or seventeenth century imagining, as
we mostly do, that it was any part of the purpose of domestic
glass to shut out the view&mdash;less need in those days!&mdash;he
employed in most cases a material which was not merely
translucent but absolutely transparent.</p>

<p>This use of transparent glass marks a distinction, and forms
something of a new departure. It was employed to some
extent in Renaissance church work; but there it was more as a
background to the stained glass window than as a part of it.
Here the transparent glass is the window; and the design,
whether in pot-metal or in enamel, shows more or less against
the clear.</p>

<p>The relationship of certain seventeenth century windows at
Antwerp to the Italian windows on <a href="#Fig_202">pages 295</a>, <a href="#Fig_204">299</a>, <a href="#Fig_242">352</a>, is
obvious. They may be quite possibly founded upon them.
There is the same arrangement of subjects in cartouches, set
in geometric glazing of clear glass. But in the Italian windows
one kind of glass is used throughout (the little pieces of
thin pot-metal colour in the cartouches, and so on, scarcely
count); and the proportion of the painted work to clear glass
is so schemed that, although you may feel that the plain work
wants just a touch of enrichment to bring it all together, you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a><br /><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>are not asked deliberately to imagine yourself to be looking
through, beyond the painting, into space.</p>

<small>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Photo-Tint</span>&#8221; by James Akerman, London, W. C.</small></span></p>

<p>The detail in these windows from the Certosa in Val d&#8217;Ema, near
Florence, is all outlined and painted in brown upon clear white glass,
the flesh warmer in tint than the rest; the high lights are brushed out
of a matt tint, and some pale stain is washed in. The artful thing about
the design is, the cunning way in which the borders are planned, so as
to avoid the absolute parallelism of marginal lines. For the rest the
design is rather characteristically Late Renaissance, though the
relation of border to cartouche, and of both together to clear glass, is
better than usual. It will be noted that these are not strictly domestic
windows; but they are designed to be seen about on a level with the eye,
and from a distance of not more than ten feet, which is as far as the
width of the cloister allows one to get away from them.</p>

<p>They fulfil, therefore, altogether very much the conditions which apply
generally to domestic glass, and may be taken, if not as types of
domestic work, at least as something on the way from the church to the
house. This, though the common type of Italian Renaissance grisaille,
was not invariable. At S. Frediano, Lucca, for example, there is a white
window, which, except for a little medallion in its centre, might at a
glance almost pass for thirteenth century work: the Cinque-Cento scroll
is so rendered, with cross-hatched ground and all, as to suggest the
early medi√¶val craftsman; it is centuries away from Da Udine in style.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 160px;">

<span class="caption">204. <span class="smcap">Certosa in Val d&#8217;Ema.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The domestic quarry window differed, in medi√¶val work, in
no respect from church work. In the sixteenth century it
took rather a new form. It consisted no longer of a more
or less diaper-like all-over pattern, but of a panel, designed
to be glazed in quarries. Here, again, is an approximation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
to the seventeenth century practice of leading up pictures in
rectangular panes, but only an approximation. There is this
important difference, that the quarry window starts from the
lead lines, and is religiously designed within them.</p>

<p>Thus to accept, the simple square and obviously fit lines of
quarry glazing, and to expend his art in painting upon them,
simplifies the task of the glass painter; and he very frequently
fell back upon that plan, more readily perhaps when he
happened to know more about painting than about glazing.
That was Da Udine&#8217;s case, who is credited with the design
of the windows in the Laurentian library at Florence, as of
those at the Certosa in Val d&#8217;Ema. They bear a date some
few years after his death; but they are so like what he certainly
would have done that, directly or indirectly, the design
is clearly due to him. The one illustrated on <a href="#Fig_203">page 298</a> is quite
one of the best of these windows; in the others the ornament
is even less coherent. The characteristic arabesque is painted
in brown enamel, with redder enamel for the flesh tints, some
yellow stain, and a little blue enamel in the heraldic lozenge,
all upon clear white glass. The effect is delicate and silvery
and no appreciable amount of light is excluded (a point usually
of some importance in domestic work); but, though the main
forms are designed within the lead lines, one feels that these
have not been considered enough, that the leads compete with
the painting, and that the bars, in particular, which are far
thicker than need be, and occur with unnecessary frequency
(in fact, at every horizontal quarry joint but one), very seriously
mar the effect of delicate painting. That is as much as to say
that the design, graceful and fanciful as it is, does not fulfil the
conditions of quarry glass.</p>

<p>It is not enough for complete success in this form of window
that the quarry lines shall be the basis of the design; the
painting also must be strong enough to hold its own against
leads and bars. That is hardly the case with the exceptionally
delicate ornament in the Dutch glass <a href="#Fig_205">opposite</a>. But here, notwithstanding
that the scroll is slighter than the Italian work
and more delicately painted, the central patch of enamel colour
in the shield and mantling does, to some extent, focus the
attention there, and so withdraw the eye from the lead lines.
The window is not merely cleverly designed; it is a frank,
straightforward, manly piece of work, marred only by the
comparative heaviness of the leads. The truth is that a glass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a><br /><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>painter becomes so used to lead lines, and gets to take them
so much for granted, that they do not offend him; and he is
apt to forget how obtrusive they may appear in the eyes of
the unaccustomed. Hence his sometimes seemingly brutal
treatment of tenderly painted ornament.</p>

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">205. <span class="smcap">Dutch Quarry Window, S. K. Museum.</span></span></p>

<p>Other good examples of Dutch domestic glass, not quite
so good as this, but painted with admirable directness, are
to be found at the <i>Mus√©e des Antiquit√©s</i> at Brussels. At the
Louvre also the Dutch work is good. There are two lights
there in which cartouches enclosing small oval subjects (fables)
spread over the greater part of the quarry glazing, leaving only
the lowermost of them comparatively empty. On these are
painted butterflies, a dragon-fly, even a gad-fly, almost to the
life. These flies upon the window pane, like the little miniature
figures in the bottom corner quarries on <a href="#Fig_205">page 301</a>, are trivial
enough in idea; but the idea is cleverly and daintily expressed;
and one does not expect much else than triviality in seventeenth
century design. Moreover, in the privacy of domestic
life it is permitted to be trivial.</p>

<p>For dignity of treatment it would be difficult to match the
specimen of Flemish glass shown on <a href="#Fig_206">page 304</a>, now at Warwick
Castle. Like the Dutch and Italian work, it is painted on clear
glass but without the prettiness of flesh tint, and the background
to the ornament (it shows dull grey in the print) is brilliant
yellow stain. This little light and its companion on <a href="#Fig_54">page 98</a>
are as large in style as they are beautiful in effect.</p>

<p>There is a gayer touch in the less seriously decorative panel
of French work in the Louvre given on <a href="#Fig_208">page 307</a>. In that pot-metal
is used for the dark ruby of the outer dress, and for the
little bits of blue rather cunningly let into the spandrils of the
arch. The fancifully designed canopy, the arabesque, and a
portion of the drapery are in stain, all delicately painted upon
clear glass, and glazed mainly on quarry lines&mdash;from which,
however, the designer saw fit to depart. What he meant by
the unfortunate circular lead line about the head is difficult
to imagine. It can hardly be, like other erratic leading, the
result of mending. No fracture could possibly have steered so
carefully between the figure and the ornament. It looks almost
as if at the last he had lost confidence in his technique, and,
in trying vainly to avoid lead lines, had ended in giving them
extraordinary emphasis.</p>

<small>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Photo-Tint</span>&#8221; by James Akerman, London, W. C.</small></span></p>

<p>In ultra-delicate domestic work the leads are more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
ever the difficulty. One is uncomfortably conscious of them
in the wonderful series of windows&mdash;formerly at Ecouen, and
now in the Ch√¢teau de Chantilly&mdash;in which is set forth in forty
pictures the story of Cupid and Psyche. A specimen of these
is given on <a href="#Fig_160">page 218</a>, thanks to the friendly permission of
Monsieur Magne, who illustrates the whole of them in his
admirable monograph of the Montmorency glass. The legend
to the effect that Raffaelle designed and Palissy painted them,
is past all possible belief; but they are very remarkable
specimens of sixteenth century work, restored about the period
of the First Empire, and mark somewhere about the high-water
mark of French domestic picture glass.</p>

<p>A glance at these windows is enough to show that they
were never schemed with any definite view to glazing. Rather
it would appear that the pictures were first designed and then
the leads introduced where best they could be disguised. But
the disguise is everywhere transparent. Such gauzy painting is
inadequate; it hides nothing. You see always the thick black
lines of lead, cruel enough, but clinging in a cowardly way to
the edges of weak forms, sneaking into shadows, and foolishly
pretending to pass themselves off as the continuation of painted
outlines not one-twentieth part so strong as they. The sparing
use of glazing lines makes them all the more conspicuous. They
must originally have asserted themselves even more than they
do now; for the accidental lead lines introduced in reparation,
however much they damage the pictures, do in a measure
support the original glazing lines, and pull the windows together.
The Chantilly glass goes to prove the impossibility of satisfactorily
disposing of the leads in very small figure subjects in
grisaille. In work on a larger scale it wants only a man who
knows his trade to manage it. Witness what was done in
church work.</p>

<p>The propriety of executing figures in grisaille at all has been
called in question by Viollet le Duc. &#8220;Every bit of white
glass,&#8221; he said, &#8220;should be diapered with pattern traced with
a brush; and, since this treatment is not possible in flesh
painting, flesh ought not to be painted.&#8221; Moreover, he says
that grisaille has always the appearance of vibrating, and the
vibration fatigues the eye; therefore, he argues, it is labour lost
to paint white figures. Far be it from an ornamentist to deny
that a great deal too much importance is attached to figure
work in decoration. But the amount of tracing necessary on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a><br /><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a><br /><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>white glass is relative. In grisaille it is quite safe to leave some
glass clear; and, if it is not worth while to paint figures, is it worth
while to paint anything worth looking at, or worth painting?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">207. <span class="smcap">Louis XIII. and Anne of Austria.</span></span></p>

<p>The truth is, it wearies the sight to look at any glass for
long at a stretch, and for a mere <i>coup d&#8217;&#339;il</i> the most brutal
workmanship would often do. But, if work is ever to be seen
from near, the charm is gone when once you know how coarse
it is. One tires of crude work, and delights more and more in
what is delicate. Whoever has taken pleasure in such work
as the windows at S. Alpin at Troyes would find it hard to
renounce the figure in grisaille.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 268px;">

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">208. <span class="smcap">Domestic Glass, The Louvre.</span></span></p>

<p>To return to the leading of grisaille. Of the two extremes,
the bold, even the too bold, acknowledgment of the constructional
lines of a window, is far preferable to the timid attempt
to conceal them. The glaziers of the Renaissance eventually
got over the difficulty by the simple plan of inserting into
quarry windows (usually unpainted) or into pattern work of
plain glass only, little panes of painted glass. In this way
there are introduced into some windows at the Ch√¢teau
de Chaumont some very beautiful little portrait medallions,
outlined with a firmness and modelled with a delicacy which
remind one of the drawings of Clouet. At the Germanic
Museum at Nuremberg are some similar medallion heads,
quite Holbein-ish in character. A later portrait panel, lacking
the style and draughtsmanship of these, but very cleverly
painted (by Linard Gontier they say), is reproduced on <a href="#Fig_207">page
305</a>. It represents, as the inscription and cypher go to show,
Louis Treize and Anne of Austria, as bride and bridegroom.
Its date, therefore, speaks for itself. Another little pane by
Gontier, from the H√¥tel des Arquebusiers at Troyes, now in
the library there, is given on <a href="#Fig_211">page 310</a>. The characteristic
ornamental work surrounding this, though not forming a consecutive
frame to the picture, is of about the same period
with it (1621). Its design consists of that modified form of
Arab foliation (compare it with the detail on <a href="#Fig_242">page 352</a>), which
was very much used in damascening and niello work; indeed,
the French still call that kind of pattern &#8220;<i>nielle</i>.&#8221; Here it is
traced in a fine brown outline, and filled in partly with yellow
stain and partly with blue enamel. The effect is pleasing.</p>

<p>It was in Switzerland that glass painting other than for
churches was most extensively practised. The Council
Chambers of Swiss towns, and the halls of trade and other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a><br /><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>guilds, were enriched with bands of armorial glass across the
windows; and throughout the sixteenth century it was the
custom to present to neighbouring towns or friendly Corporations
a painted window panel. Great part of these have been
dispersed, and in Switzerland they are now perhaps rarer than
in the museums of other countries. The Germanic Museum at
Nuremberg and the H√¥tel Cl√ªny, at Paris, are rich in Swiss
glass; and we have some at South Kensington. Superb
examples, however, still remain in Switzerland&mdash;for example, in
the Rath-haus at Lucerne&mdash;though they belong to a period as late
as the first ten years of the seventeenth century.</p>

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">209. <span class="smcap">Pierced Quarries, Warwick.</span></span></p>

<p>The usual form of design consisted of a sort of florid canopy
frame of moderate dimensions, enclosing a shield or shields of
arms, supported by fantastically dressed men-at-arms. There
was often great spirit in the swagger of these melodramatic
swashbucklers, admirably expressive of the idea which underlies
all heraldry: &#8220;I am somebody,&#8221; they seem to say, &#8220;pray
who are you?&#8221; It is a comparatively modest specimen of this
class that is presented on <a href="#Fig_50">page 90</a>. In the windows of a private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
house it was frequently the master and mistress who supported
the armorial shield, all in their Sunday best, and very proud
of themselves too. Little Bible subjects were also painted,
mainly in grisaille. It was for window panes that Holbein
drew the Stations of the Cross, now among the chief treasures
of the museum at B√¢le. These also must be classed with
domestic work. They may in some cases have been destined
for a church; but they would much more appropriately decorate
a private oratory.</p>

<span class="caption">210. <span class="smcap">Quarry of Fretted Lead.</span></span>
</div>

<p>These heraldic or pictorial panes go even beyond the delicacy
of cabinet pictures, and are sometimes more on the scale of
miniatures; but of such miniature painting the Swiss were
masters. They carried craftmanship to its very furthest point,
and among them traditions of good work lingered long after
they were quite dead in France. Of English work there was
not much; and of that the less said the better.</p>

<p>Far into the eighteenth century the Swiss still had a care for
their window panes, and, when painting went out of fashion,
engraved them with armorial or other devices. Precisely that
kind of engraving was employed also upon polished mirrors, of
which one finds examples in Italy.</p>

<p>Unpainted quarry windows in English houses were sometimes
relieved, at the same time that ventilation was secured, by the
occasional introduction (in the place of glass) of little fretted
panels of pierced lead, as shown on <a href="#Fig_209">page 308</a>. <a href="#Fig_210">Below</a> is a
diamond-shaped piercing of the Jacobean period.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<br />
THE USE OF THE CANOPY.</h3>

<p>No one can have paid much attention to stained glass without
observing the conspicuous part played in its design by the
quasi-architectural canopy.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as it, in a sense, enshrines the figure, there exists
some sort of symbolic reason for its use. But that is not
enough to account for its all but universal employment. A
more obvious excuse for it is, the purpose it fulfils in the construction
of design. It is a means of accounting for the position
of figures midway up the window, perhaps one above the other,
and not standing upon the sill. It is at once framework and
support to them, preventing them from seeming to float there
in space.</p>

<p>Where the designer of the church designed also the glass for
it, it was almost inevitable that he should plan it more or less
upon architectural lines; and so we find that in windows known
to have been designed by architects the canopy is very often
the most conspicuous part of the design. But at all times the
master-builder must have been a power, and at all times also
even glaziers and glass painters must have been so intimately
acquainted with forms of architecture, that it is not surprising
they should have introduced them into their work.</p>

<p>The fact is, the designer happens upon something like a
canopy almost without intending it, and, having arrived so
far, perfects the resemblance to it. Suppose a window of four
long lights, in each of which it is desired to introduce three
figures. That means dividing it horizontally into three, which
may be done by the use of bands of inscription, as at <i>a</i> in the
diagram <a href="#Fig_212">overleaf</a>: there is no suggestion of architecture there.
Supposing you wish to frame the window at the sides, so as
to stop the picture, as at <i>b</i>, to the left of the diagram; you have
still no very distinct suggestion of architecture. But if, the
better to frame the picture, you add an extra band of colour, as
shown at <i>c</i>, you arrive at once at something so like perspective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
as to indicate an architectural elevation. Indeed, that is precisely
the form the canopy takes sometimes in Italian glass.
Even when the cinque-centist framed his picture merely in
lines he could hardly help giving them the appearance of
mouldings, painting upon (as at Arezzo) egg-and-tongue or
other familiar architectural enrichment in white and stain.</p>

<p>In the clerestory at Freiburg is a window in which the serried saints
appear at first sight to be simply framed by lines of pale purple; but
on examination these resolve themselves into a simple architectural
elevation, with even a hint of unsuspected shadow in it. The date of
that example is 1512; and canopies, not to go back to Gr√¶co-Roman
decoration, begin with the beginning of Gothic. It is adduced,
therefore, to show, not the origin of canopy work, but how inevitably
something of the sort occurred. Its immediate source is clearly
imitation. The thing is borrowed straight from architecture, and
indicates, it may justly be said, if not a certain lack of inventive
faculty on the part of the designer, at least some disinclination to
take the pains to invent.</p>

<p>So in the thirteenth century we have funny little glass penthouses
over the figures of saints, architectural in form but not
in colour; in the fourteenth windows are crossed by rows of
tall brassy disproportioned tabernacles, as yet flat fronted; in
the fifteenth, white ghosts of masonry pretend to stand out
over the figures; in the sixteenth, altar-like, or other more or
less monumental, structures, are pictured with something like
the solidity of stonework; and eventually the canopy is merged
in painted glass architecture, which joins itself on as best it can
to the actual masonry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>The forms of canopy typical of each period of architecture
have been discussed in the several chapters on design, but
something remains to be said upon canopy work in general,
and upon particular instances of it.</p>

<p>The Early canopy goes for nothing as design. Its one merit
is that it is inconspicuous. One could wish that the Decorated
were equally so. There is, as a rule, no shutting your eyes to its
mass of overpowering shrinework. When, by way of exception,
it chances to be modest it is sometimes more interesting&mdash;as
where it is scarcely more than a cusped arch, or where, as at
Strassburg, it takes the form of an arcaded band across the
window, in which are series of little demi-figures. At Cologne
Cathedral also sundry saints are pigeon-holed in this way.
<i>Apropos</i> of this, it should be mentioned that it invariably adds
to the interest of a canopy, when; for example, the broad shaft
of a Decorated canopy enniches angels and other figures, or
when they are introduced among its pinnacles or in its base.
The wide-spreading German canopy affords scope for variety
of design not possible so long as the structure is confined
within a single light. In some four-light windows at Erfurt
(1349-1372) the broad shafts of the canopies, with saints in
separate niches, occupy the whole width of the outer lights,
leaving only two lights for the central picture. In a five-light
window at Strassburg the canopy is five-arched, allowing
separate arches in the outer lights for figures of saints, whilst
the three central ones cover a single subject.</p>

<p>In canopies which include niches with separate subsidiary
subjects, these are sometimes by way of prelude to the main
story. In the cathedral at Berne is something of the kind.
There, among the pinnacles of the canopy which crowns
the subject of the Adoration, are seen the Kings setting out
on their pilgrimage, journeying by night, having audience of
Herod, and arriving finally at the city of Bethlehem.</p>

<p>In the great altar-like canopies of the Renaissance there is
sometimes a gallery above, with angels or other figures, which
give points of colour amidst the white. In any case, the canopy
is usually more interesting when it is peopled.</p>

<p>The Perpendicular canopy is in effect much more pleasing
than what had gone before, but it sins in its simulation of
stonework. There also little figures in white and stain are
very effectively introduced into the shafts and other parts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
the construction, but more in the form of architectural
sculpture. There are some very interesting instances of this
at Fairford, though the canopies themselves are not otherwise
peculiarly interesting.</p>

<p>The useful device of low, flat-topped canopies, adopted in
the nave windows at Cologne Cathedral, seldom occurs out of
Germany. It is there most successful. Indeed, these particular
canopies are interesting examples of the interpenetration of
architectural tracery as well as of its moderate and modest use.</p>

<p>Late German canopies are often much more leafy than
French or English; they are less architectural&mdash;or rather, the
architecture breaks out into more free and flowing growth. The
charm of Late Gothic canopy work, as was said, lies in its
colour, or in the absence of colour&mdash;in its silvery effect, that is
to say. And one may safely add that quite the most satisfactory
canopies, in whatever style, are those in which white largely
prevails, modified by stain, but preserving its greyish character.
In later Renaissance work white is still largely used; but it is
made less brilliant by painted shadow, and so has less to excuse
its architectural pretensions. At Milan there is a window
in which what should be white is in various granular tints
of brown.</p>

<p>The coloured canopy, to which the Italians adhered (as
well as to the border enclosing it), does not frame them as the
white glass does. The idea appears to be, on the contrary, that
it should form part of the picture. Elsewhere than in Italy
coloured canopies, other than yellow, are rare; but they occur.
There are, for example, the hideous flesh-coloured constructions
peculiar to Germany. At Troyes are some not unsatisfactory
little canopies in green, and others in purple (1499).
At Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne is an effective canopy (1526-1537) of
golden arabesque on purple. At Freiburg (1525) is a steely-blue
Renaissance canopy, from which depend festoons of
white and greenish-yellow, against the ruby ground of the
subject. And there are others satisfactory enough. But so
invariably effective is the framework of white and stain, that
to depart from it seems almost like giving up the very excuse
for canopies.</p>

<p>The Late Gothic canopy work does most effectually frame
the pictures, and gives light, of course, at the same time. It
goes admirably with the colour scheme, which includes always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
a fair quantity of white, even in comparatively rich figure
subjects. There is no denying, nor any desire to deny, its
altogether admirable effect. If the effect were not otherwise to
be obtained, the end would justify the means. But the effect
is due simply to the setting of the subjects in a framework
of white, not to the architectural character of the design.
All that those Perpendicular canopies do could be done equally
without architectural forms at all. Canopies make no more
beautiful screens of silvery-white than, say, the Five Sisters
at York. Intrinsically they are less interesting than pattern
work. They give less scope for arranging subjects variously,
just as one will; and they allow less range for the fancy of the
artist. The most interesting canopies, and among the most
effective, are those Early Renaissance picture frames (French,
German, or Italian) which, whilst just sufficiently suggesting
something near enough to architecture to be called canopies,
are really little more than arabesque. One might almost say
they are pleasing in proportion as they depart from the quasi-architectural
formula.</p>

<p>The enormous value of the mass of white afforded by the
canopy, as a setting for colour, has reconciled us too readily
to its use. Why not this mass of white without pretended
forms of masonry, without this paraphernalia of pinnacles?
The architect alone, perhaps, in his heart likes canopy work,
and would prefer it to any other kind of ornamental device.
When he plans a window, or directs its planning, forms of
architectural construction occur to him naturally. Supposing
him to be an artist (as we have perhaps a right to expect him
to be) he produces a fine thing; but were he to work upon
more workmanlike lines, or, to speak quite precisely, more upon
the lines of the worker in glass, how much better he would do&mdash;being
an artist! In his reliance upon inappropriate structural
forms, he makes the obvious mistake of depending upon
the kind of thing with which he is most familiar, not the thing
especially called for. Each particular craft has a technique of
its own.</p>

<p>One other class of person also loves canopy work&mdash;the tradesman;
but his affection for it is less disinterested, and more
easily accounted for. The stock canopy (as every one knows
who has been, as it were, behind the counter) is a famous
device for cheapening production. The examples chosen for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
illustration throughout these pages do, on the whole, much
more than justice to the periods which they were chosen to
represent; but, taken altogether, they do not, even so, form a
very effective plea for canopy work.</p>

<p>Were the canopy more defensible than it is in glass, it would
still have monopolised far too large a place in the scheme
of medi√¶val and Renaissance design. We owe largely to it,
in connection with the gradually increasing claims of figure
work, the all but extinction of pattern glass. Figure work is
practically implied by the canopy. Occasionally, indeed,
architecture has formed the whole <i>motif</i> of a window; but
the case is so rare that it does not count. Once in a while
there may be excuse, and even occasion, for almost any device.</p>

<p>There is no valid reason of art why figures and figure
subjects should not be framed in ornament, designed indeed
with reference to the architecture of the building, but not in
the least in the likeness of architecture. This ornament might
perfectly well be in white and stain. Ornamental setting in
colour does occur in thirteenth century medallion windows,
and again (though only by exception) in certain Early Renaissance
glass; but by that time pictures, as a rule, absorbed all
the interest of design. The instinct which makes us want to
give even pictured personages some sort of roof above their
heads is more natural than logical. Anyway, to make windows
to look like niches in the wall, is an absurd ideal of design, and
the nearer the glass painter gets to it the further he has gone
off the track. If anything in the nature of a canopy be desirable,
clearly it should be constructed on the lines, not of masonry,
but of glazing.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<br />
A PLEA FOR ORNAMENT.</h3>

<p>There is a direction in which glass has never been fully
developed, that of purely ornamental design. This is the more
to be deplored because that direction is the one in which was
most scope for the peculiar depth and brilliancy of colour
characteristic of mosaic glass. Ornament was used in the
thirteenth century not only as a setting for figure medallions,
but as of sufficient interest to form of itself most beautiful
windows in grisaille. Presently the attractions of figure work
put an end to that; and, furthermore, the preference for picture
naturally led to the development of design in the direction
of glass painting, which lent itself so much more readily than
mosaic to pictorial expression. We owe to that, not only the
perfection of glass painting, and its ultimate degradation, but
the neglect of latent possibilities in more thoroughly mosaic
glass, aye, in pure glazing.</p>

<p>Even in figure work, much might be done for clerestory and
other distant work, at all events, in pure mosaic glass. Those
who have not closely observed old glass have no conception of
the amount of leadwork there is in the windows they admire, at
the very moment that they deprecate leading, so little do these
interfere with the design, when disposed with the cunning of a
craftsman. One can imagine figures on a large scale boldly
blocked out, with broad shadows, in which not only the shadows,
but even the reflected lights in them, might be glazed in pot-metal,
and from the floor of a big church the leads would be
inappreciable. But, except in work upon an absolutely heroic
scale, there would always be the difficulty of the flesh; the
features would have to be painted; and glass pictures of this
kind would needs be designed with a severe simplicity not
calculated to satisfy the modern pictorial sense.</p>

<p>The advocates of painting complain that due consideration of
the qualities of glass would limit the artist to the baldest kind
of pictorial effect. Something certainly must be sacrificed to fit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
treatment of the material, or glass suffers, whatever picture may
gain. That is what has happened. But if so much sacrifice
is necessary to figure, why always adopt that form of design?
Why not sometimes at least abandon subject, and seek what can
best be done in glass, even though that be barbaric? It is not
quite certain but that glass really lends itself only to a rather
barbaric kind of design, or what we are barbarous enough to
call barbaric. This is certain: the interest of figure work has
put an end to ornamental glass. It has become almost an
article of faith with us that, to the making of a window worth
looking at, figure design is indispensable. That should not be
so. And, seeing that picture does not afford full scope for the
qualities which glass-lovers most dearly love in glass, it seems
rather cruel that picture should so largely preponderate in its
design as to suppress the possibilities in the way of ornament.
Why should it be so?</p>

<p>There are two very important reasons for the introduction of
figure into glass, the one literary, the other artistic. In the
first place, we love a story, that is no more than human;
we want to know what it is all about, that is no more than
rational; and figure subjects afford the most obvious means of
satisfying those cravings of ours. But artists want these
cravings satisfied by means of art. Some of them, perhaps,
think more of the means employed than of the end achieved,
and would have &#8220;art for art&#8217;s sake.&#8221; Theirs is a doctrine of
very limited application. Sanity insists upon subordination
of the means to end; and art is not an end in itself, nor is
craftsmanship. It is not, therefore, for one moment suggested
that story, sentiment, meaning, in windows, should be ruthlessly
sacrificed to craftsmanship, even though expression implied
the use of figure, which it does not. What is claimed, is
merely this: that when you employ a material or a process
some consideration is due to it.</p>

<p>Before undertaking to express an idea, it is always as
well for the artist to consider how far its expression is consistent
with art. If it can be expressed only at the cost of all
that is best in art, it were better to adopt some other means
of expression. If a particular craft is your one means of
expression, and that particular thing cannot well be said
in it, then say what can be said; it will be to much more
purpose than saying even a better thing and saying it ill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
The better the thought, the greater the crime of saying it
inadequately.</p>

<p>After all, the sentiment, or what not, which people ask
for in glass, and which compels figure work, is not, in the
majority of instances, by any means so important, even in
their eyes, but that they would sacrifice it readily enough
if they knew the price in art at which they would have to
pay for it. Let patrons of stained glass, if they care for
art, ponder this statement; it is not spoken in haste, but
in conviction.</p>

<p>There is one reason of sentiment which would argue against
great part of the use that is made of figure work, at all events
in church glass, the doubt, namely, as to how far it is possible,
in these days, to reconcile the devout with the decorative
treatment of sacred subjects. We are all admiration when we
gaze up at the splendid figure of Moses in the great transept
window at Chartres. But it is the artist in us that is entranced,
the lover of glass, and especially of colour; the artless worshipper
might feel that the dignity of the Lawgiver would
perhaps have been better expressed with less attention to
decorative effect. We are not shocked at the archaic effigy,
because we realize that reverence underlies its simplicity. In
modern work it is otherwise. Artistic intention, admirable or
not from the √¶sthetic point of view, is responsible for the
introduction into our churches of delineations of all that
Christians hold sacred so ridiculous, it is a wonder devout
worshippers allow them to be there. The excuse for glass
is its decorative effect. Its value is in its colour. A Saint in
stained glass (to mention no higher Person) stands in a window
for just so much colour: is not that rather a degradation of
the saint?</p>

<p>In the second place, apart altogether from what has been
called the literary interest (which no one will dispute) there
is in figure work a charm, altogether artistic, in the very
unexpectedness of the colour-patches you get in it, not
accidental quite, but in many instances at least, inspired
by accident. The besetting sin of ornament is obviousness;
it has a way of distributing itself too symmetrically and evenly,
of laying its secret bare to the most casual glance. We see at
once there is nothing to find out in it, and our interest drops
to zero.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
In figure design, on the contrary, there are breaks even
in the very best balanced scheme; there is always something
unexpected, unforeseen, something to kindle interest; in fact,
the difficulty is, there, to distribute the composition evenly
enough. The question arises whether this sameness, and
consequent tameness, of ornament, the way the points of
intended interest recur with irritating frequency and regularity,
resolving themselves into mere spots&mdash;whether this defect is
inherent in ornament, and inseparable from it.</p>

<p>Proof that it is not is afforded by heraldry, distinctly a branch
of ornamental design, in which, for precisely the same reasons
as in figure work, we get just that inevitable deviation from
system, and more especially from symmetry, which seems
necessary to the salvation of ornament. Where by happy
chance an ornamental window has been patched with glass
not belonging to it, or where portions of it have been misplaced,
we get similar relief from monotony. Here the unexpectedness
of contrast, colour, and so on, is accidental; in heraldry it is,
in the nature of things, unforeseen of the artist, and unavoidable.
May not similar results be obtained of set purpose and
design? Surely they may. Were it otherwise, it would be
worth falling back now and then upon haphazard, and letting
colour come as it might.</p>

<p>Happily there is no occasion for that feeble sort of fatalism.
Given a colourist and a man with that sense of distribution
(whether of line, mass, or colour) which makes the artist, what
is to hinder him from deliberately planning so much of surprise
as may be necessary to tickle the appetite for the ornamental?
The ogre in the path is what we call economy. Because
ornament can without doubt be more cheaply executed than
figure work, it is taken for granted that it must be reserved
by rights for cheap work. What else is there to recommend
it? And, that being so, ornament being but padding,
by all means, it is argued, let it be not only cheap but of
the cheapest!</p>

<p>Design, moreover, if it be worth having at all, is costly, and
there is clearly thrift in repeating the same pattern, and even
one unit of it, over and over again. The practice of saving
design in this way has become at last so much a matter of
course, that no one thinks of designing an ornamental window,
as a whole, without repetition of pattern&mdash;except the artist;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
and with him it is a fond desire which he hopes perhaps some
day to fulfil&mdash;at his own expense.</p>

<p>Under circumstances such as these, what wonder ornament
is monotonous? It could not well be otherwise. But these
conditions are not in the nature of things. Ornamental design
has subsided because no one asks for, cares for, or encourages,
ornament. It needs only to be in the hands of an artist&mdash;not
necessarily a Holbein, but just a Rhodian potter, a Persian
carpet weaver, a medi√¶val carver, or a nameless glazier&mdash;to be
worthy of its modest place in art.</p>

<p>Considering the costliness of good figure work and the
absolute worthlessness of bad, considering the way in which
glass lends itself especially to ornament, considering how in
ornament the qualities most necessary to decorative effect and
most characteristic of the material can be obtained, surely the
wiser policy would be to do what can so readily be done.
When glass lends itself so kindly to ornament it seems a sin
to neglect it. Is it quite past praying for, that there may still
be a future for windows merely ornamental, which shall yet
satisfy the sense of beauty?</p>

<h2>BOOK III.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />
<br />
THE CHARACTERISTICS OF STYLE.</h3>

<p>What are the characteristics of the various styles in glass?
How does one tell the period of a window? These are not
questions that can be fully answered in the short space of a
chapter, which is all that can here be devoted to it; but it
may help those to whom a window tells nothing of its date,
briefly to mention the characteristics according to which we
class it as belonging to this period or that. With a view to
conciseness and to convenience of reference it will be best to
catalogue these characteristics rather than to describe them.</p>

<p>Any subdivision of glass into &#8220;styles&#8221; must be more or less
arbitrary. One style merges into the other, and the characteristics
of each overlap, so to speak. The most convenient
lines of demarcation are the centuries; for, as it happens, the
changes in manner do take place more or less towards the
century end. The one broad distinction is between Gothic
and Renaissance.</p>

<p>Gothic may best be divided into three periods&mdash;viz., Thirteenth
century and before, Fourteenth century, and Fifteenth
century and after.</p>

<p><i>Thirteenth century glass</i>, commonly called &#8220;Early English,&#8221;
or, as the case may be, &#8220;Early French,&#8221; may as well be taken
to include, for our purpose, what little remains of twelfth century
or Norman work. It includes naturally Early German
work, which is Romanesque and not Gothic in character.</p>

<p><i>Fourteenth century glass</i> belongs to the Middle or Transitional
Gothic period. We call it &#8220;Decorated,&#8221; for the inadequate
reason that its detail is naturalistic.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 210px;">
<a id="Fig_213" name="Fig_213"></a>

<span class="caption">213. <span class="smcap">St. Remi, Reims.</span></span>
</div>

<p><i>Fifteenth century glass</i>, with us &#8220;Perpendicular,&#8221; in France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
&#8220;Flamboyant,&#8221; in Germany &#8220;Interpenetrated,&#8221; may, for convenience&#8217;
sake, be taken to include so much of Gothic as may
be found lingering in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The <i>Sixteenth century</i> is more properly the period of the
Renaissance. It is better not to apply to it the Italian term
&#8220;cinque-cento,&#8221; since the greater part of it is not of the purely
Italian character which that would imply.</p>

<p><i>Seventeenth century glass</i> is to be distinguished from that of the
sixteenth mainly inasmuch as it shows more markedly that decadence which
had already begun to set in before the year 1600. It may be conveniently
described as Late Renaissance.</p>

<p><i>Eighteenth century glass</i> is not of sufficient account to be classed.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the dates above given do not quite coincide with
those of Winston, who gives Early English to 1280, Decorated to 1380,
and Perpendicular to 1530. There is here no thought of impugning his
accuracy; but it seems more convenient not to distinguish a new style
until the work begins markedly to differ from what had gone before,
especially when the marked difference happens conveniently to coincide
with the beginning of a new century; and Winston himself says of
Perpendicular work (and implies as much of Decorated) that the style
&#8220;can hardly be said to have become thoroughly established&#8221; until the
beginning of the new century.</p>

<p>We have thus a century of Middle Gothic, the fourteenth
century. What goes before is Early Gothic or Romanesque,
as the case may be; what comes after is Late Gothic, co&#339;val
for a quarter of a century or more with the Renaissance.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Early Glass.</span></h4>

<p>The first thing which strikes one in Early Glass is either its
deep rich, jewelled colour (Canterbury, Chartres), or its sober,
silvery, greyness (Salisbury; Five Sisters, York). Exception
to this alternative occurs mainly in very early ornamental
glass (<i>circa.</i> 1300&mdash;S. Denis; S. Remi, Reims; Angers), in
which white and colour are somewhat evenly mixed. Early
figure work occurs also occasionally in colour on a white
ground. The design of the richer class of windows consists
largely of figure work. The design of &#8220;grisaille&#8221; windows
consists mainly of ornamental pattern.</p>

<p><i>Composition.</i>&mdash;Rich windows are of three kinds: medallion
windows, rose windows, figure and canopy windows. Jesse
windows form an exception.  (<a href="#Page_360">Chapter XXIX.</a>)</p>

<p>1. <i>Medallion Windows</i> are the most characteristic of the
period (<a href="#Page_123">Chapter XII.</a>). These contain figure subjects, on
a quite small scale, within medallion
shapes set in ornament (Canterbury,
Chartres, etc.).</p>

<p>In the very earliest medallion windows
(Angers, Poitiers) the ordered scheme of
the medallioned window is sometimes
interrupted by subjects not strictly enclosed
in medallions. Or else, perhaps
(Chartres), the subjects take the form of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
panels one above the other&mdash;they can scarcely be called
medallions&mdash;with little or no ornament between.</p>

<p>After the first few years of the thirteenth century, however,
the figure medallions (circles, quatrefoils, etc.) occur, as a rule,
one above the other throughout the length of the light, with
perhaps a boss of ornament between; the interstices being
filled, in English glass with ornamental scrollwork, in French
with geometric diaper (<a href="#Fig_215">opposite</a>).</p>

<span class="caption">216. <span class="smcap">Detail of Medallion Window, Chartres.</span></span>
</div>

<p>In the broad windows of Norman churches (<a href="#Page_123">pages 123</a>, <a href="#Page_124">124</a>)
the medallions are proportionately large, and are subdivided
into four or five divisions, each of which is devoted to a
separate picture. In our narrower lancet lights there is no
occasion for that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>The figures in medallion subjects are few and far apart,
standing comparatively clear-cut against a plain background
(<a href="#Fig_217">page 325</a>); compacter groups indicate a later period. Landscape
is symbolised rather than represented by a conventional
tree or so; a town by an arch or two, a battlemented wall,
or the like.</p>

<p>Medallions are framed by lines of colour and beaded bands
of white, but they do not, as a rule, separate themselves very
markedly from their ornamental surroundings. The effect is
one rather indeterminate glory of intense colour.</p>

<p>Except in quite the earliest medallion windows, the strong
iron bars supporting the glass are, as a rule, bent (<a href="#Fig_217">above</a>), to
follow the outline of the medallions. That was done in no
other period.</p>

<p>2. <i>Rose Windows</i> occur mainly in French churches. They
are a variation upon the medallion window. A great Rose
window (Chartres, Bourges, etc.) may be regarded as a series
of radiating medallion lights, with subjects relatively fewer in
number, and a greater proportion of pattern work. Occasionally
they consist of pattern work altogether. Smaller Roses
(the only form of tracery met with in quite Early work) contain
very often a central circular medallion subject, the cusps or
foils round it being occupied with ornament, all in rich colour,
even though the lights below it be in grisaille.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">217. <span class="smcap">Bars in Medallion Windows.</span></span></p>

<p>3. <i>Figure and Canopy Windows</i> (<a href="#Page_40">page 40</a>) are more proper
to the clerestory and triforium of a church, but they are not
entirely confined to a far-off position.</p>

<p>With regard to them it should be mentioned that figures
under canopies, sitting, or more often standing&mdash;one above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
other in long, narrow lights&mdash;occur throughout the Gothic
periods, and even in Renaissance glass. The characteristic
thing about the Early ones is the stiffness and comparative
grotesqueness of the figures and the modesty of the canopy.
This last is of small dimensions. It may be merely a trefoiled
arch (<a href="#Fig_26">page 40</a>). Usually it is more architectural (<a href="#Fig_30">page 46</a>),
gabled, with a little roofing, and perhaps a small tower or two
rising above, not beautiful. It is in fairly strong colours. It
is so little conspicuous that it is not at first sight always distinguishable
from the background to the figure. Occasionally
the figure has no canopy at all. The saint stands front face,
straight up in his niche, in a constrained and cramped position,
occupying its full width, which is obviously insufficient.
His feet rest in an impossible manner upon a label bearing his
name; or, if that be inscribed upon a label in his hand, or on
the background behind him, then he stands upon a little mound
of green to represent the earth (<a href="#Fig_26">page 40</a>).</p>

<p>Figure and canopy alike are archaic in design, and rudely
drawn. It is seldom that a figure subject on a smaller scale
is introduced below the standing figure, as was frequently the
case in later work. Groups of figures are characteristically
confined to medallion windows.</p>

<p><i>The Border</i> is a feature in Early glass. It is broad. In
medallion windows it measures sometimes as much as one-fourth
the width of the light. It takes up, that is to say,
perhaps half the area of the window. It consists of foliated
ornament similar in character to that between the medallions.
Very broad borders occasionally include smaller figure medallions.
In figure and canopy windows the borders are less, and
simpler. Sometimes they consist merely of broad bands of
colour interrupted by rosettes of other colours. Circumstances
of proportion, and so on, influence the width of the border;
but a broad border is characteristic of the Early period.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
In Rose windows the border is of less account, and is confined, as a
rule, to the outer ring of lights, or, it may be, to their outer edge.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Detail.</i>&mdash;Ornamental detail is severely conventional. In very
Early work (<a href="#Fig_218">page 327</a>) it has rather the character of Romanesque
ornament, with straplike stalks interlacing, often enriched by a beaded,
zig-zag, or other pattern, which may be either painted upon it or picked
out of solid brown.</p>

<p>Early in the thirteenth century foliage assumes the simpler Gothic form,
with cinque-foiled, or more often trefoiled, leafage (<a href="#Fig_219">as here shown</a>).</p>

<p>When it begins to be more naturalistic it is a sign of transition to the
Decorated period. In Germany something of Romanesque flavour lingered
far into the thirteenth century (<a href="#Fig_222">page 330</a>). There is properly no Early
Gothic period there. Heraldry is modestly introduced into Early glass.
The Donor is occasionally represented on quite a small scale in the
lower part of a window, his offering in his hand; or he is content to be
represented by a small shield of arms.</p>

<p><i>Colour.</i>&mdash;The glass in Early windows is uneven in substance, and,
consequently, in colour. This is very plainly seen in the &#8220;white&#8221; glass,
which shades off, according to its thickness, from greenish or
yellowish-white to bottle colour. The colour lies also sometimes in
streaks of lighter and darker. This is especially so in red glass. The
shades of colour most usually employed for backgrounds are blue and
ruby. White occurs, but only occasionally.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 264px;">

<small>J. Akerman, Photo-lith, London, W.&nbsp;C.</small></span></p>

<p>The Early palette consists of:&mdash;</p>

<p>White, greenish, and rather clouded; red, rubylike, often streaky; blue,
deep sapphire to palest grey-blue, oftenest deep; turquoise-blue, of
quite different quality, inclining to green; yellow, fairly strong, but
never hot; green, pure and emerald-like, or deep and even low in tone,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a><br /><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>but only occasionally inclining to olive;
purple-brown, reddish or brownish, not violet; flesh tint, actually
lighter and more pinkish shades of this same purple-brown. In very early
work the flesh is inclined to be browner.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 81px;">

</div>

<p>It must be remembered that, though the palette of the first glaziers was
restricted, the proceeding of the glass-makers was so little scientific
that they had no very great control over their manufacture. No two pots
of glass, therefore, came out alike. Hence a great variety of shades of
glass, though produced from a few simple recipes. They might by accident
produce, once in a way, almost any colour. A pot of ruby sometimes
turned out greenish-black. Still, the colours above mentioned
predominate in Early work, and are clearly those aimed at.</p>

<p><i>Workmanship.</i>&mdash;The glazing of an Early window is strictly a mosaic
of small pieces of glass. Each separate colour in it is represented by a
separate piece of glass, or several pieces.</p>

<p>The great white eyes, for example, of big clerestory figures are
separate pieces of white glass, rimmed with lead, and held in place by
connecting strips of lead, which give them often very much the
appearance of spectacles (<a href="#Fig_26">page 40</a>). In work on a sufficiently large
scale the hair of the head and beard are also glazed in white, or
perhaps in some dark colour, distinct from the brownish-pink flesh tint
peculiar to the period (same page). No large pieces of glass occur.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 76px;">
<a id="Fig_223" name="Fig_223"></a>

<span class="caption">223. <span class="smcap">S. Kunibert, Cologne.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Upon examination the window proves to be netted over with lines of lead
jointing, much of which is lost in the outlines of the design.</p>

<p>In large clerestory figures and the like, masses of one colour occur,
but they are made up of innumerable little bits of glass, by no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
means all of one shade of colour; whence the richness in tone.</p>

<span class="caption">224. <span class="smcap">S. Jean-aux-Bois.</span></span>
</div>

<p><i>Painting.</i>&mdash;In Early glass painting plays a very subordinate part.
Only one pigment is used, and that not by way of colour, but to paint
out the light and define form.</p>

<p>Details of figure and ornament are traced in firm strong brush lines.</p>

<p>Lines mark the exaggerated expression of the face, the close folds of
the spare drapery wrapped tightly round the figure, the serration of
foliage, and so on (<a href="#Fig_20">pages 33</a>, <a href="#Fig_24">37</a>, <a href="#Fig_214">324</a>). Lines, in the form of sweeping
brush strokes or cross-hatching, are used also to emphasise such shading
(not very much) as may be indicated in thirteenth century work, or
perhaps it should rather be said that the lines of shading are
supplemented very often by a coat of thin brown paint, not always very
easily detected on the deep-coloured glass of the period.</p>

<p><i>White Windows, or &#8220;Grisaille.&#8221;</i>&mdash;Grisaille assumes in France
the character of interlacing strapwork all in white. Sometimes
this is quite without paint (<a href="#Fig_12">page 25</a>). Plain work of the kind
occurs also with us; but it is dangerous to give a date to
simple glazing. That at Salisbury (<a href="#Fig_15">page 26</a>) is probably not
of the very earliest.</p>

<p>In France, as with us, such strapwork is associated with
foliated detail, traced in strong outline upon the white glass
and defined by a background of cross-hatched lines which
go for a greyer tint (<a href="#Fig_224">above</a>).</p>

<p>After the beginning of the thirteenth century, this strapwork
is sometimes in colour, or points of colour are introduced in the
shape of rosettes, etc., and in the border (<a href="#Fig_85">pages 137</a>, <a href="#Fig_86">138</a>).</p>

<p>In England there is from the first usually a certain amount
of coloured glass in grisaille windows (<a href="#Fig_93">pages 141</a>, <a href="#Fig_225">332</a>). Sometimes
there is a considerable quantity of it (Five Sisters, York);
but it never appears to be much. The effect is always characteristically
grey and silvery.</p>

<small>J. Akerman, Photo-lith, London, W. C.</small></span></p>

<p>So long as the painted foliage keeps closely within the formal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a><br />
<a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
lines of strapwork, etc., it is, at all events in English glass, a
sign of comparatively early thirteenth century work.</p>

<p>Later in the century the scroll winds rather more freely
about the window (<a href="#Fig_97">page 143</a>).</p>

<p>The omission of the cross-hatched background and the
more natural rendering of the foliation (<a href="#Fig_251">page 386</a>) announce the
approach to the Decorated period.</p>

<p>Figure subjects in colour, planted, as it were, upon grisaille
or quarry lights (Poitiers, Amiens), and grisaille borders to
windows with figures in rich colour (Auxerre), are of exceptional
occurrence.</p>

<p>Winston gives the year 1280 as the limit of the Early
period, but there seems no absolute reason for drawing the
line at that date. The use of stain, which was the beginning
of a new departure in glass, does not pronounce itself before the
fourteenth century. It seems, therefore, more convenient to
include the last twenty years of the century in the first period,
and to call it thirteenth century, accepting the more naturalistic
type of foliage, when it occurs, as sign of transition; for, apart
from that, the later thirteenth century work is not very markedly
different from what was done before 1280.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Fourteenth Century.</span></h4>

<p><i>Decorated or Intermediate Gothic.</i>&mdash;Decorated glass grows
characteristically livelier in colour than Early glass; at first
it becomes warmer, owing to the use of more yellow, then
lighter, owing to the use of white. It does not divide itself so
obviously into coloured and grisaille.</p>

<p>The figure subjects include, as time goes on, more and more
white glass. The grisaille contains more colour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>Figures and figure subjects are now very commonly used
in combination with grisaille ornament in the same window.
That is a new and characteristic departure (<a href="#Fig_112">page 159</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="Fig_226" name="Fig_226"></a>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">226. <span class="smcap">S. Urbain, Troyes.</span></span></p>

<p><i>Composition.</i>&mdash;Figure windows occur, indeed, with little or
no ornament, in which case the subjects are piled one above
the other, in panels rather than medallions, or under canopies.
When the canopies are insignificant the result is one apparently
compact mass of small figure work, as deep and rich perhaps
in colour (S. Sebald&#8217;s, Nuremberg) as an Early medallion
window; but the colour is not so equally distributed; it occurs
more in patches.</p>

<p>Decorated canopies, however, are usually, after the first few
years, of sufficient size to assert themselves as very conspicuous
patches of rather brassy yellow, which in a window of several
lights (and windows now almost invariably consist of two or
more lights) form a band (or if there are two or more tiers of
canopies, a series of bands) across the window.</p>

<p>In the case of grisaille windows also, figures or figure
subjects are introduced either in the form of shaped panels or
under little canopies, and take the form of a band or bands of
comparatively rich colour across a comparatively light window.</p>

<p>When these canopies are themselves pronounced, the window
shows alternate bands of figures (rich), canopies (yellowish),
and ornamental pattern (whitish). In any case these horizontal
bands across the window mark departure from the
earlier style.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 214px;">

<span class="caption">227. <span class="smcap">Ch√¢lons.</span></span>
</div>

<p><i>Canopies.</i>&mdash;Canopies occur now over subjects as well as
single figures.</p>

<p>The canopy is designed in flat elevation. Any indication of
perspective betokens the end of the period. It has broadish
shafts, usually for the most part white, which terminate in
pinnacles (<a href="#Fig_107">page 155</a>). It has seldom any architectural base:
the figures stand upon grass or pavement. It has usually a
three-cusped arch, and above that a pointed gable decorated
with crockets and ending in a finial. Crockets and finial are
usually in strong, brassy yellow. Above are pinnacles and
shrinework in white and colour, including as a rule a fair
amount of yellow.</p>

<p>It may rise to a great height, dwarfing the figure beneath it.
This occurs very especially in German work.</p>

<p>Sometimes the most conspicuous thing in the window is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
this disproportionate canopy. Its very disproportion is characteristic
of the period.</p>

<p>In German work one great brassy canopy will frequently be
found stretching right across the several lights of the window,
over-arching a single subject. This triptich-like composition
will occupy, perhaps, two-thirds of the height of the window.
The background behind the pinnacles of this canopy may be
either of one colour or of geometric diaper in mosaic (elsewhere
characteristic of the Early period), finished off by a more or
less arbitrary line&mdash;a cusped arch, for instance&mdash;above which
is white glass. This kind of canopy has, by way of exception, an
architectural base.</p>

<p>Another German practice is to fill the window with huge circular subject
medallions, occupying the entire width of the window, and intersected by
the mullions.</p>

<p>Single-light windows have sometimes a central elongated medallion or
panel subject (without canopy), above and below which is ornamental
grisaille.</p>

<span class="caption">228. <span class="smcap">Early Decorated Figure, Troyes.</span></span>
</div>

<p><i>Borders.</i>&mdash;All windows have, as a rule, borders; but they are
narrower than in Early work.</p>

<p>Tracery lights, which now form a conspicuous part of the window, are, as
a rule, also each separately bordered, often with a still narrower
border in colour, or it may be only a line of colour.</p>

<p>Grisaille windows have usually coloured borders, foliaged
or heraldic (as <a href="#Fig_227">above</a>). The border does not necessarily frame
the light at its base; very often there is an inscription there.
Between the coloured border and the stonework is still
invariably a marginal line of white glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>Sometimes, more especially in tracery, this white line is broad enough
to have a pattern painted upon it, in which case there is no coloured
border. Or this white border line may be enriched at intervals by
rosettes or blocks of colour upon it. Or, again, it may be in part
tinted with pale yellow stain.</p>

<p>Some such border is usually carried round each separate tracery light,
with the result that Decorated tracery may usually be distinguished at a
glance from later work by a certain lack of breadth about it.</p>

<p>There is no need to say more about Decorated tracery, seeing that the
idea of this epitome is to enable the amateur to form some opinion as to
the period of a window, and not to prompt the designer. The geometric
character of the stonework proclaims the period, and, unless there is
something in the design of the glass to indicate a later date, it may be
taken to belong to it. It cannot well be earlier if it fits.</p>

<span class="caption">229. <span class="smcap">S. Ouen, Rouen.</span></span>
</div>

<p><i>Stain.</i>&mdash;Yellow stain is proof positive that the glass is not
much earlier than the fourteenth century, for it is only about that
time that the process of staining white glass yellow was discovered.
The occurrence therefore of white and colour upon
the same piece of glass&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, not glazed up with it, but stained
upon it, is indicative of Middle or Late Gothic.</p>

<p>Stained yellow is always purer and clearer than pot-metal;
when pale it inclines to lemon, when dark to orange. It is
best described as golden. In comparison with it pot-metal
yellow is brownish or brassy.</p>

<p>This yellow stain warms and brightens Decorated windows,
especially those in grisaille.  It naturally does away with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
a certain amount of glazing, for colour is now not entirely
mosaic. Bands of yellow ornament in white windows, if
stained, have lead on one side of them at most.</p>
<p>The hair of angels comes to be stained yellow upon white
glass, which towards the fifteenth century takes the place of
the flesh tint.</p>

<p><i>Figures.</i>&mdash;Figures are still rather rudely drawn. They do
not always fill out their niches, which, indeed, frequently overpower
them. In attitude they pose and would be graceful.
There is some swing about their posture, but it is often exaggerated.
Drapery becomes more voluminous, fuller and freer,
as shown <a href="#Fig_228">opposite</a>.</p>

<p>At the back of the figure hangs commonly a screen diapered
damask-fashion&mdash;the diaper often picked out of solid paint.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 72px;">
<a id="Fig_230" name="Fig_230"></a>

<span class="caption">230. <span class="smcap">14th Century German.</span></span>
</div>

<p><i>Grisaille.</i>&mdash;The distinguishing characteristics of Decorated
grisaille are fully described in the chapter dealing with it. It
has usually a coloured border. The foliated pattern no longer
follows the lines of the white or coloured strapwork, but it does
not interlace with the straps (<a href="#Fig_115">pages 163</a>, <a href="#Fig_226">333</a>).</p>

<p>Coloured bosses adorn the centre of the grisaille panels.
Frequently these take the form of heraldic shields, planted,
as it were, upon the grisaille.</p>

<p>The practice of cross-hatching the background to grisaille foliage dies
out in France and England. In Germany it survives throughout the period;
or, it may be, the background is coated with solid paint, and the
cross-hatching is in white lines scratched out of that.</p>
<p><i>Naturalism.</i>&mdash;The foliation of the ornament is now everywhere
naturalistic. That is the surest sign of the period, at first the only
sign of change. In grisaille patterns and in coloured borders you can
identify the rose, the vine, the oak, the ivy, the maple, and so on
(<a href="#Fig_114">pages 162</a>, <a href="#Fig_120">166</a>, <a href="#Fig_123">168</a>).</p>

<p>In Germany, the design of ornamental windows consists often of
naturalistic foliage in white and colour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span> upon a coloured
ground, the whole rich, but not so rich as Early glass (<a href="#Fig_128">pages 171</a> <i>et
seq.</i>). There also occur windows stronger in colour than ordinary
grisaille, designed on lines more geometric than those of French or
English glass of the period (<a href="#Fig_126">page 170</a>).</p>

<p><i>Colour.</i>&mdash;Glass gets less streaky, evener, and
sometimes lighter in tint, as time goes on.
Flesh tint gets paler and pinker, and at last
white; &#8220;white&#8221; glass gets more nearly white.</p>

<p>Much blue and ruby continue to be used; but more green is introduced,
and more yellow, often the two in combination. In fact, there is a
leaning towards combinations of green and yellow, rather than the red
and blue so characteristic of Early glass. Green is frequently used for
backgrounds. The pure bright emerald-like green gives way to greens
inclining more to olive. In some German windows, green, yellow, and
purple-brown predominate. Occasionally, in the latter part of the
century, pale blue is modified by yellow stain upon it, which gives a
greenish tint.</p>

<p><i>Painting.</i>&mdash;Outline is still used; but it becomes more delicate.
Shading is still smeared on with a brush. But in the latter half of the
century it was the practice to stipple it, so as to soften the edges and
give it a granular texture. This is not quite the same thing as the
&#8220;stipple or matt shading&#8221; described on <a href="#Page_64">page 64</a>, where the glass was
entirely coated with a stippled tint and the lights brushed out.</p>

<p>Decorated glass is plentiful in England and Germany, not so abundant in
France.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Fifteenth Century.</span></h4>

<p><i>Perpendicular Glass.</i>&mdash;By the fifteenth century
the glass painter had quite made up his mind in
favour of more light. He makes use of glass in
larger sheets, and of lighter and brighter colour.
His white is especially purer than before, and he
uses it in much greater quantities.</p>

So decidedly is this so, that a typical fifteenth century
window strikes you as a screen of silvery-white glass in which
are set pictures or patches of more or less brilliant, rather than
intensely deep, colour.</p>

<p><i>Design.</i>&mdash;Design takes, for the most part, the form of figure
and canopy windows, schemed somewhat on the same lines as
in the Decorated period&mdash;the subjects, that is to say, cross the
window in horizontal bands.</p>

<p>But there is so much white glass in the canopy work&mdash;it is
practically all in white (as stone) touched with stain (as
gilding)&mdash;and it so entirely surrounds the figure subjects, that
you do not so much notice the horizontal bands (into which the subjects
really fall when you begin to dissect the design) as the mass of white
in which they are embedded.</p>

<p><i>Canopies.</i>&mdash;The larger Perpendicular windows are now crossed by
stone transoms, so that very long lights do not, as a rule, occur.</p>

<p>Each light has a canopy, without any enclosing border (<a href="#Fig_233">233</a>). The canopy
stands, as it were, in the window opening, almost filling it, except
that, above, behind the topmost pinnacles, are glimpses of red or blue
background, not separated from the stonework by so much as a line of
white, heretofore of almost invariable occurrence. The hood and base of
canopy are shown in misunderstood perspective, indicating usually a
three-sided projection (<a href="#Fig_234">page 342</a>).</p>

<p>Its shafts and base rest upon the ground, on which are
painted grass and foliage, all in white and stain. When
standing figures occupy the place of honour, the base may very
likely include a small subject, illustrative of a scene in the life
of the personage depicted above. Or the base may be a sort
of pedestal (<a  href="#Fig_136">page 179</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>The figures usually stand upon a chequered mosaic pavement
in black and white, or white and stain, not very convincingly
foreshortened (<a  href="#Fig_141">page 185</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 172px;">
<a id="Fig_233" name="Fig_233"></a>
<img src="images/fig_233.png" width="172" height="250" alt="Perpendicular Canopy" title="Perpendicular Canopy" />
<span class="caption">233. <span class="smcap">Perpendicular Canopy.</span></span>
</div>

<p>In the canopy may be little windows of pot-metal colour,
and in the base perhaps a spot or two of colour; but, whatever
the amount of pot-metal (never much) or of stain (often a good
deal), the effect is always silvery-white; and as time goes on
the canopy becomes more solidly and massively white. The
groining at the back of the niche just above the figures is a
feature of the full-blown style. The vault is usually stained,
less often glazed in pot-metal. There is more scope for this
coloured groining in windows where the canopy runs through
several lights. That is more common in France and Germany
than with us. In English work each light has, as a rule, its
own canopy.</p>

<p>In France, and more especially in Germany, the canopies are
not seldom in yellow instead of white, golden in effect instead
of silvery. Sometimes white and yellow canopies alternate
(Nuremberg, Munich). The German canopy is often more
florid, and less distinctly architectural than the English.</p>

<p>Perpendicular canopies are more in proportion to the figures
under them than Decorated. Usually they are important enough
to be a feature in the window, if not the feature. Sometimes,
however, they are quite small and insignificant (East window,
York), in which event the subjects appear more like a series of
small panels, one above the other. In that case there is likely
to be a large amount of white glass in the subjects themselves
(<a  href="#Fig_174">pages 252</a>, <a  href="#Fig_232">339</a>). Possibly the background is white. In any
case, there is usually a fair share of white glass in the drapery of
figures. The faces also are almost invariably white, often with
stained hair; and this white flesh is characteristic of the period.</p>

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">234. FIGURE AND CANOPY WINDOWS, BOURGES.</span></p>

<p>Until the turn of the century, landscape or architectural
accessories are, to a large extent, in white and stain, against
a blue or ruby ground.</p>

<p>Variety of colour in the background (or a further amount of
white) is introduced by means of a screen of damask behind
the figure, shoulder high, above which alone appears the usual
blue or ruby background, diapered. The screen may be of
any colour: purple-brown is not uncommon. When scale
permits, the damask pattern is often glazed in colours, or in
white and stain upon pot-metal yellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a><br />
<a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>Heraldic shields are more conspicuous than ever in the design. Donors
and their patron saints are often important personages in the foreground
of the picture.</p>

<p><i>Tracery.</i>&mdash;Tracery lights being now more of the same shape as the
lights below, the glass is designed on much the same plan. That is to
say, they also contain little figures under canopies. These are often
entirely, or almost entirely, in white and stain, only here and there a
point of colour showing in the background, more especially about their
heads.</p>

<p>Trefoiled, quatrefoiled, three-sided, or other openings not
adapted to canopy work, have usually foliated ornament in
white and stain, with border line of white and stain, the background
painted in solid brown. Inscribed scrolls and emblematical
devices in white and stain also occur in the smaller
tracery lights.</p>

<p><i>Grisaille.</i>&mdash;Grisaille takes almost invariably the form of
quarries. The pattern of the quarries consists ordinarily of
just a rosette or some such spot in the centre of the glass,
delicately outlined and filled in with stain. A band of canopied
figures sometimes crosses quarry windows, the pinnacles
of the canopies breaking into the quarries above. Figures
occur also often in white and stain, against a quarry ground,
without canopy, standing perhaps on a bracket, or on a mere
label or inscription band (York Minster). Occasionally we
get subjects altogether in white and stain, without quarry
glazing. In Germany unpainted roundels, or circular discs of
white glass, take the place of quarries (<a href="#Fig_199">page 292</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 187px;">
<a id="Fig_235" name="Fig_235"></a>

<span class="caption">235. <span class="smcap">Fairford.</span></span>
</div>

<p><i>Detail of Ornament.</i>&mdash;The detail of Perpendicular foliage is
no longer very naturalistic; it has often the appearance of
being embossed or otherwise elaborated. It is most commonly
in white with yellow stalks.</p>

<p><i>Borders.</i>&mdash;The border is no longer the rule, except in quarry
windows. It is now very rarely used to frame canopies. Where
it occurs it is usually in the form of a &#8220;block&#8221; border, differing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
only from that of the Decorated period by the character of the
painted detail. Borders all in white and stain also occur.</p>

<p>The border does not follow the deeply cut foils of the window
head. These are occupied each by its separate round of glass
painted with a crown, star, lion&#8217;s head, or other such device, in
white and stain, against which the coloured border stops.</p>

<p><i>Stain.</i>&mdash;Abundant use of beautiful golden stain is typical of
the period. Stain is always varied, sometimes shading off
by subtle degrees from palest lemon to deep orange. The
deliberate use of two distinct tones of stain, as separate tints,
say of a damask pattern, argues a near approach to the sixteenth
century. So does the use of stain upon pot-metal yellow.</p>

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">236. SCRAPS OF LATE GOTHIC DETAIL.</span></p>

<p>Other signs of the mature style are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The very careful choice of varied and unevenly coloured
glass to suggest shading or local colour.</p>

<p>2. The use of curious pieces of accidentally varied ruby to
represent marble, and the like.</p>

<p>3. The abrasion of white spots or other pattern on flashed
blue (the abrasion of white from ruby begins with the second
half of the century).</p>

<p>4. The introduction of distant landscape in perspective, and
especially the representation of clouds in the sky, and other
indications of attempted atmospheric effect.</p>

<p>5. The treatment of several lights as one picture space,
without canopy.</p>

<p><i>Colour.</i>&mdash;White glass is cooler and more silvery, more purely
white. Red glass is less crimson, often approaching more to a
scarlet colour. Blue glass becomes lighter, greyer; sometimes
it is of steely quality, sometimes it approaches to pale purple.
More varieties of purple-brown and purple are used. Purer
pink occurs.</p>

<p><i>Drawing.</i>&mdash;In the fifteenth century the archaic period of
drawing is outgrown. Figures are often admirably drawn,
more especially towards the end of the period, at which time
the folds of drapery are made much of.</p>

<p><i>Painting.</i>&mdash;Painting is much more delicate. The method
adopted is that of stippling (<a href="#Page_64">page 64</a>).</p>

<p>Figure and ornament alike are carefully shaded, quarry
patterns and narrow painted borders excepted.</p>

<p>For a long while painters hesitated to obscure the glass
much; they shaded very delicately, and used hatchings, and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a><br /><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>sort of scribble of lines, to deepen
the shadows. As a result the shading appears sometimes weak, but the
glass is always brilliant.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 185px;">
<a id="Fig_237" name="Fig_237"></a>
<img src="images/fig_237.png" width="185" height="250" alt="Fairford" title="Fairford" />
<span class="caption">237. <span class="smcap">Fairford.</span></span>
</div>

<p>With the progress of the century stronger stipple shading was used; more
roundness and greater depth of shadow was thus achieved, at
proportionate cost of silvery whiteness and brilliancy in the glass.</p>

<p>The characteristic of the later technique was that it depended less upon
mosaic, and more upon paint.</p>

<p>Leads were not used unless they were constructionally unavoidable; and
it was sought to avoid them. The nimbus, for example, was glazed in one
piece with the head (<a href="#Fig_145">page 189</a>), stained perhaps, or with a pattern in
stain upon it, to distinguish it from the face; or it showed white
against the yellow hair.</p>

<p>From the lead lines alone of an Early window, and of many
a Decorated one, you could read the design quite plainly. The
later the period the less that is so. By the end of the fifteenth
century the lead lines convey very often little or no idea of
the picture, which they hold together but no longer outline.
Canopies, for example, are sometimes leaded in square quarries,
without regard to the drawing, except where that must be
(<a href="#Fig_234">page 342</a>).</p>

<p>A pretty sure sign of period is afforded by the way the leads
give, or do not give, the design. Exceptions are mentioned
on <a href="#Page_73">page 73</a>. Where leads seem to occur more or less as it
happens, as though they might have been an after-thought,
that is most positive proof of Late work.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Sixteenth Century.</span></h4>

<p>Renaissance glass does not, like Gothic, divide itself into
periods. It was at its best when it was still in touch with
medi√¶val tradition.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="Fig_238" name="Fig_238"></a>

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">238. <span class="smcap">French Renaissance, Mosaic.</span></span></p>

<p>The finest work in the new manner must be ascribed therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
to the first half of the sixteenth century. After that its merits
belong more to picture than to glass.</p>

<p>Apart from details of architecture, ornament (as <a href="#Fig_238">above</a>),
costume and so on, which at once proclaim the style, it is
difficult to distinguish between Gothic and Renaissance glass
of the very early sixteenth century. The distinction does
not in fact exist; for Gothic traditions survive even in work
belonging, according to the evidence of its detail, to the
Renaissance.</p>

<p><i>Design.</i>&mdash;Design takes now mainly the pictorial direction.
It spreads itself more invariably over the whole face of the
window. The canopy, for example, is seldom confined to a
single light.</p>

<p><i>Canopies.</i>&mdash;The canopy scheme is at first not widely removed
from Gothic precedent, although the detail may be pronouncedly
Renaissance. It frames the subject as before;
but it is less positively white. It is enriched with much more
yellow stain; and the mass of white and stain is broken by
festoons and wreaths of foliage, fruit, and flowers, medallions
with coloured ground, ribbons, or other such features, in
pot-metal colour. A simple Fran√ßois Ier canopy is given on
<a href="#Fig_239">page 349</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes these canopies consist rather of arabesque ornament
than of anything that can properly be called architectural,
in white and yellow (<a href="#Page_350">page 350</a>), or perhaps all in yellow, upon
a ground of pot-metal colour (<a href="#Page_205">page 205</a>); that is to say, the
setting out of the window and the technique employed are
absolutely Gothic, and perhaps not even very late Gothic,
whilst the detail is altogether Renaissance in design. This
mosaic manner (as at Auch) bespeaks, of course, the early
years of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>Another sure sign of lingering Gothic influence is where the
round arch is fringed with cusping.</p>

<p>The more typically Renaissance form of design is where a
huge monumental structure fills the greater part of the window,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
not canopying a subject, but having in front of it a figure group
(Transept of S. Gudule, <a href="#Page_71">page 71</a>). The foreground figures stand
out in dark relief against the architecture and the sky beyond,
seen through the central arch. Into this grey-blue merges very
often a distant landscape, painted in great part upon the blue,
and really seeming to recede into the distance. The effect of
distance is largely obtained by contrast with the strong shadow
of the soffits and sides of the arch seen in perspective.</p>

<p>We have here four characteristics of Renaissance glass:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The monumental canopy with figures in front of it.</p>

<p>2. Strong contrast of light and shade.</p>

<p>3. Fairly accurate perspective in the architecture.</p>

<p>4. Something like atmospheric effect in the landscape, which
is painted more or less upon the sky.</p>

<p>When in a canopy the shadowed portions of the architecture
are glazed in deep-coloured glass (purple, as a rule),
and not darkened by painting, it indicates the early part of
the century. The canopy, instead of being arched, ends sometimes
in a rich frieze and cornice (Church of Brou). When
it is in two stages, enclosing two subjects, the lower one
has naturally this horizontal entablature (Chapel of the Holy
Sacrament, S. Gudule).</p>

<p>A less usual treatment is where the figures do not occupy
the foreground, but are seen through the arch. The subject
occupies, in fact, very much the position of a painted altar-piece
in a carved stone altar.</p>

<p>Foreground figures prove often to be donors and their
patron saints. The head of the window above the great architectural
canopy, as it is convenient to call it, is usually of
plain white glass, glazed in rectangular or diamond quarries
(<a href="#Page_71">page 71</a>).</p>

<p>A coloured ground above a Renaissance canopy indicates
Gothic tradition, and an Early period therefore (S. Jacques,
Li√®ge).</p>

<p>More to the latter half of the century belong the pictorial
compositions in which architecture, more or less proper to the
subject, fills great part of the window, the foremost arches
adapting themselves, sometimes, to the stonework. In this
case the architecture is in white glass, more or less obscured
by painted shadow; and pot-metal colour occurs only in the
figures, where it is perhaps quite rich, in occasional columns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
of coloured marble, and in a peep of pale blue distance seen through
some window or other opening (<a href="#Fig_158">page 213</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 245px;">
<a id="Fig_239" name="Fig_239"></a>
<img src="images/fig_239.png" width="245" height="250" alt="Fran√ßois Ier Canopy" title="Fran√ßois Ier Canopy" />
<span class="caption">239. <span class="smcap">Fran√ßois Ier Canopy, Lyons.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The grey-blue distance has often figures as well as landscape and
architecture painted upon it; to represent verdure it is stained green.
Blue is more usual than white as a ground; but that also occurs,
similarly painted. The not very usual landscape in white, with a blue
sky above, in the windows of King&#8217;s College Chapel, Cambridge, belongs
to the early part of the century.</p>

<p><i>Tracery.</i>&mdash;In small windows the subject, or its canopy, is
often carried up into the tracery lights (<a href="#Fig_247">page 368</a>), or the
architecture ends abruptly and horizontally at the springing
of the arch, and the heads of the lights are treated as part of
the tracery.</p>

<p>Tracery lights often contain figure subjects. Very commonly
they are occupied by figures of angels robed in white and stain,
or in rich colour, or with colour only in their wings, playing
upon musical instruments, bearing emblems, scrolls, and so on,
all on a coloured ground (<a href="#Fig_188">page 280</a>). There occur also, but less
frequently, cherubic heads, portrait medallions, badges, twisted
labels, or other devices, upon a ground of ruby, pale blue,
purple, or purple-brown. A purple or purplish background is
of the period.</p>

<p>Coloured grounds are used without borders. White grounds
are usually diapered with clouds.</p>

<p>There is no very distinctive treatment of rose windows. They
are filled as pictorially as they well can be. They contain,
perhaps, a central subject and in the outer lights angels,
cherubs, and the like, much as in other tracery lights.</p>

<p><i>Ornament.</i>&mdash;The detail of their ornament is a ready means of
distinguishing Renaissance windows. In place of Gothic leafage
we have scrollwork of the marked arabesque or grotesque
character derived from Italy. It needs no description.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
Screens and draperies have often patterns in white and stain
on ruby and other coloured grounds, produced by abrading the
red and painting and staining the white thus exposed. The
process may be detected by the absence of intervening lead
between the white or yellow and the deep ground.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 152px;">

<span class="caption">240. <span class="smcap">Church of S. Peter, Cologne.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Other damask patterns are stained on the coloured glass
without abrasion, yellow on blue giving green, on purple olive,
and so on.</p>

<p>Ornamental windows scarcely go beyond quarry work, with
a border of white and stain. Except in quarry windows,
borders are seldom used.</p>

<p>Grisaille windows scarcely occur. The little subjects in
white and stain painted upon a single piece of glass, usually
circular and framed in quarries or in a cartouche set in plain
glazing (<a href="#Fig_242">page 352</a>), belong to a class by themselves.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 111px;">

<span class="caption">241. <span class="smcap">S. Jean, Troyes, 1678.</span></span>
</div>

<p><i>Technique.</i>&mdash;In many respects the technique of the Renaissance
glass painter is only a carrying further of the later Gothic means. He
uses more and more white glass, employing it also as a background; he
uses more shades of coloured glass, especially pale blues, greens, and
purples; he chooses his glass more carefully for specific purposes; he
uses more coated glass, and abrades it; he makes greater use of stain,
staining upon all manner of colours&mdash;ruby, blue, purple,
green&mdash;and even painting in stain, and picking out high lights upon
it in white. He paints delicate work more delicately. Flesh-painting he
carries to a very high point of perfection, more especially in the
portraits of Donors. In strengthening his shadows he eventually gets
them muddy. At first he used to hatch them to get additional strength;
eventually he was not careful always so much as to stipple them. He uses
often a warmer brown pigment for flesh painting, and by-and-by resorts
to a quite reddish tint by way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span> of local colour; he uses large
pieces of glass when he can, and glazes his backgrounds and other large
surfaces in rectangular panes. Above canopies he comes to use pure white
glass, as if to suggest that the canopy is solid, and beyond only
atmosphere.</p>

<p>The one quite new departure in sixteenth century technique
was the use of enamel colour (see <a href="#Page_77">Chapter VIII</a>.). That
began to come into use towards the middle of the century.
When you detect the least touch of enamel colour in a window,
other than the pinkish flesh tint, you may suspect that
it belongs to the second half of the century; when it seriously
affects the design and colour of the window, you may be sure
it does. But it is not until quite the end of
the century that mosaic anywhere practically
gives way to enamel painting.</p>

<p>The sixteenth century, therefore, includes, broadly speaking, all that
is best in Renaissance glass and much that is already on the decline.
There is a tide in the affairs of art; and after the full flood of the
Renaissance, sweeping all before it, glazing and glass painting sank to
the very lowest ebb, out of sight in fact of craftsmanship. Only here
and there, by way of rare exception, was good or interesting work any
longer done,&mdash;as for example at Troyes, where good traditions,
piously preserved in a family of exceptionally skilful glass painters,
were followed long after they were elsewhere extinct.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Seventeenth Century.</span></h4>

<p>You may recognise seventeenth century work not so much
by any new departure in design (except that it aims more and
more at the effect of an oil picture, and that the portrait of
the Donor and his family constitutes the picture) as by its
departure from the old methods, the methods above described;
by the introduction of pure white glass, glazed in geometric
pattern, in the upper half of the window or, it may be, as a
background; by the use of enamel paint instead of coloured
glass; by the abuse of heavy shading (in the vain attempt
to get chiaroscuro), and by a loss, consequently, of the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
translucency and brilliancy; by the aggressiveness of the lead lines
(now that it is sought to do as much as possible without them); by the
adoption of thin-coloured glass, toned by paint, instead of deep
pot-metal; by the occurrence of whole panes of glass coated with solid
paint; by the decay of the enamel; and by the general dilapidation of
the window.</p>

<p>The unlearned must not be misled by the shabbiness of a window, by the
breakages, the disfiguring leads which represent repair, the peeling off
of the paint, and so on, into the supposition that these are signs of
antiquity. On the contrary, the very method of its making was the saving
of Early glass, and Late work owes its vicissitudes largely to the
mistaken process adopted in its execution,&mdash;by which you may know
it.</p>

<p>It would be beyond the scope of a book about glass to go
more thoroughly into the characteristics of style generally.
Enough to indicate what more especially concerns the subject
in hand.</p>

<p>Without some slight acquaintance with the course of art, it
will perhaps be difficult to trace the development of glass
design. Historical or antiquarian knowledge of any kind will
make it more easy. Not merely the character of ornament
or architecture, but the details of lettering, costume,
heraldry, give evidence in abundance to those who can read
it; but it is with art and craftsmanship that we have
here to do.</p>

<p>The data given in this chapter and throughout are derived
from the study of old work. Winston and other authorities
have been referred to only to corroborate impressions gained
by personal experience,&mdash;the experience only of a designer, a
workman, a lover of glass, professing to no more learning than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
a student must in the course of study acquire. Nevertheless
these few notes on what is characteristic in design and workmanship,
may, it is hoped, be helpful to artists, craftsmen,
students, and lovers of art, and perhaps sufficient for their
guidance.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
<br />
STYLE IN MODERN GLASS (A POSTSCRIPT).</h3>

<p>It is easy, and it is only too common a thing, for the designer
to depend for inspiration over much upon old work; but until
he knows what has been done he is not fully equipped for
his trade.</p>

<p>Moreover, a workman skilled only in his craft may be prolific
in good work: one, on the other hand, learned only in
arch√¶ology, is, in the nature of things, sterile. He may know
as much about old glass as Winston, and fail as utterly even to
direct design a-right as he did at Glasgow. The Munich windows
there are glaring evidence as to what a learned antiquary
and devoted glass-lover can countenance. Too surely the fire
of arch√¶ological zeal warps a man&#8217;s artistic judgment.</p>

<p>What, then, about historic style? Are we to disregard it
in our work? That question may be answered by another:
What about old work? Old work, it is argued, should be our
guide. Well, old work preaches no adherence to past styles.
It went its own way, in delightful unconsciousness that the
notion could ever occur to any one deliberately to go back to
a manner long since out of vogue; and when the idea of a
Renaissance did occur to the artist, he very soon made it
something quite different from the thing he set out to revive&mdash;if
ever that was his deliberate intention.</p>

<p>It is too lightly assumed that &#8220;the styles&#8221; are there, ready
made for us, and that all we have to do is to make our choice
between them, and take the nearest to a fit we can find. So
many of us only learn to copy, whereas the whole use of copying
is to learn. Artists study style for information, not authority.</p>

<p>The truth is, no style of old glass is fashioned to our use.
Early Gothic glass has most to teach us with regard to the
mosaic treatment of the material, and perhaps also about
breadth and simplicity of design; but when it comes to figure
drawing and painting, here is surely no model for a nineteenth
century draughtsman. Renaissance work has most to teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
in the way of painting and pictorial treatment; but it is not
an exemplar of workmanlike and considerate handling of glass.</p>

<p>Because Early work was badly drawn, because Decorated
was ill-proportioned, because Perpendicular was enshrined in
stone-suggesting canopy work, because Renaissance was apt
to depend too much upon finish, because seventeenth century
work was overburdened with paint; must a man, therefore,
according to the style of the building for which his work
is destined, make it rude, misproportioned, stonelike, ultra-finished,
or over-painted?</p>

<p>It happens that Early figure work in glass was mostly in deep
rich colour. Are we to have no figures, therefore, in grisaille?
It happens that later glass was, at its best, delicate and silvery
in effect. Are we, therefore, to have no rich windows any
more? Thirteenth century pictures were diminutive in scale.
Are we to have no larger pictures ever? Sixteenth century
subjects spread themselves over the whole window. Are we
never to frame our glass pictures? And as to that frame, are
we to choose once and for all the ornamental details of this
period or that, or the formula of design adopted at a given time?</p>

<p>Whether in the matter of technique or treatment, of colour
or design, no one style of old glass is enough for us. What
does an historic style mean? Partly it means that during such
and such years such and such forms were in fashion; partly it
means that by that time technique had reached such and such
a point, and no further. Must we rest there? If at a certain
period in the history of design the scope of the glass painter
was limited, his art rude, shall we limit ourselves in a like
manner? If at another it was debased, ought we to degrade our
design, just because the building into which our work is to go
is of that date, or pretends to be? It was the merest accident
that in the thirteenth century drawing was stiff and design
more downright than refined, that the appliances of the glazier
were simple, and the technique of the painter imperfect. It
was an accident that silver stain was not discovered until
towards the middle of the fourteenth century, that the idea of
abrading colour-coated glass did not occur to any one until
nearly a century later, that the use of the glass-cutter&#8217;s diamond
is a comparatively modern invention, and so on.</p>

<p>Out of the very scarcity of the craftsman&#8217;s means good came;
and there is a very necessary lesson to us in that; but to throw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
away what newer and more perfect means we have (all his
knowledge is ours, if we will) is sheer perversity.</p>

<p>To affect a style is practically to adopt the faults and follies
of the period. If you are bent upon making your glass look
like sixteenth century work, you glaze it in squares, and
introduce enamel. To treat it mosaically would be not to
make it characteristic enough of the period for your pedant,
notwithstanding that sixteenth century glass was, by exception,
treated in a glazier-like fashion.</p>

<p>Should one, then, it may be asked, take the exception for
model? The answer to that is: take the best, and only the
best. It is no concern of the artist whether it be exceptional
or of every-day occurrence; some kinds of excellence can never
be common. Is it good? That is the question he has to ask
himself.</p>

<p>With regard to the use of the forms peculiar to a style&mdash;Gothic
Tracery or Renaissance Arabesque&mdash;that is very much
a question of a man&#8217;s temperament. Has he any sympathy
with them? Does that seem to him the thing worth doing?
If his personal bias be that way, who shall say him nay?
Assume even that the conditions of the case demand Decorated
or Italian detail, it does not follow that they demand precisely
the treatment of such detail found in the fourteenth or the
sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The style of a building is not to be ignored. To put, nowadays,
in a thirteenth or fourteenth century church windows
in the style of the fifteenth or sixteenth would be absurd;
to put in a fifteenth or sixteenth century church windows
in the style of the thirteenth or fourteenth, more foolish still.
But it does not follow that in a church of any given century,
the modern windows should be as nearly as possible what
would have been done in that century.</p>

<p>No man in his senses, no artist at all events, ever denied
that the designer of a stained glass window must take into
consideration the architecture of the building of which his
work is to form part. The only possible question is as to
what consideration may be due to it.</p>

<p>The arch√¶ologist (and perhaps sometimes the architect)
claims too much. Certainly he claims too much when he
pretends that the designer of a window should confine himself
to the imitation of what has already been done in glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
belonging to the period of the building, or of the period which
the building affects. Why should the modern designer submit
to be shackled by obsolete traditions? What is his sin against
art, that he should do this dreary penance, imposed by architectural
or ecclesiastical authority? And what good is to
come of it?</p>

<p>The unfortunate designer of modern glass is asked to conform
both to the technique and to the design of glass such
as was executed at the period to which belongs the building
where his glass is to go, no matter how inadequate the one or
the other, or both, may be. So far as technique is concerned,
it can scarcely be questioned that the only rational thing to
do, is to do the best that can be done under the circumstances.</p>

<p>That is equally the thing to aim at in design, simply one&#8217;s level
best. It seems strange that there should be two opinions on
the subject. A building of some centuries past (or in that
style) is to be filled with nineteenth century glass. Choose
your artist: a man whose work has something in common
with the sentiment of the period of the building, a man with
education enough to appreciate the architecture and what it
implies, with modesty enough to think of the decorative purpose
of his work and not only of his cleverness; let such
a man express himself in his own way, controlled only by the
conditions of the case; and there would be little likelihood that
his work would, in the result, shock either the feelings or the
taste of any but a pedant&mdash;and if art is to conform to the taste
of the pedant, well, it is time the artist shut up shop. Why will
men of learning and research discount, nay, wipe out, the debt
art owes to them, by claiming what is not their due?</p>

<p>Even though it were necessary or desirable that we should
restrict ourselves to what might have been done in the
thirteenth century or in the sixteenth, that would not argue
that we must do only what was done. Surely we may be
allowed to do what the men of those days might conceivably
have done had they possessed our experience. Surely we need
not go for inspiration to the glass of a period when glass was
admittedly ill-understood, inadequate, poor, bad. It is quite
certain that the thirteenth century workmen did not realise all
that might be done in painted glass, quite certain that those
of the seventeenth did not appreciate what might be done
in mosaic glass. It would be sheer folly to paint no better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
than a thirteenth century glazier, because our window was
destined for Salisbury Cathedral, to make no more use of the
quality inherent in glass than was made by a painter of the
seventeenth century, because it was designed for St. Paul&#8217;s.
Those who are really familiar with old work know that, even
in periods of decline, work was sometimes done which showed
no falling away from good tradition. You may find Renaissance
glass almost as mosaic in treatment as thirteenth
century work. But because that was comparatively rare,
because the average work of the period was much less satisfactorily
treated, modern Renaissance must, it is absurdly
assumed, be on the same unsatisfactory lines.</p>

<p>Suppose we want modern Italian Renaissance, and, further,
that we wish not only to retain the character of Renaissance
detail but to get good glass, suppose also that we do not want
forgery,&mdash;the thing to do would be, to inspire oneself at the
very best sources of Italian ornament&mdash;carving, inlay, goldsmith&#8217;s
work, embroidery, no matter what (ornament is
specifically mentioned because it is in ornament that the
tyranny of style is most severely exercised), and to translate
the forms thence borrowed into the best glass we can do.
That, of course, is not quite so easy as appropriation, wholesale;
it implies research, judgment, a thorough knowledge of
glass; but it would certainly lead, in capable hands, to nobler
work, and work which might yet be in the Italian spirit. The
danger is that it would clash, not with Renaissance feeling, but
with preconceived ideas as to what should be.</p>

<p>Our affectations of old style would be much more really like
old work if they pretended less to be like it. Had the old men
lived nowadays they would certainly have done differently from
what they did.</p>

<p>An artist in glass cannot safely neglect to study old work,
more especially in so far as it bears upon modern practice.
It is for him to realise, for example, what artistic good there
was in early archaic design, what qualities of colour and so on
came of mosaic treatment, what delicacy is due to the liberty
of the later Gothic glass painter, what fresh charm there was
in the more pictorial manner of the Cinque-Cento, and at what
cost was this bought. Questions such as these are much
more to the point than considerations of the date at which
some new departure may have been made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
The several systems on which a window design was set out,
the various methods of execution&mdash;mosaic and paint, pot-metal
and enamel, smear-shading and stipple, cross-hatching and
needle point, matting and diapering, staining and abrading&mdash;all
these things he has to study, not as indices of period, but that
he may realise the intrinsic use and value of each, that he may
deduce from ancient practice and personal experience a method
of his own.</p>

<p>Doubtful and curious points concern the antiquary not the
artist. He had best keep to the broad highway of craftsmanship,
not wander off into the byeways of arch√¶ology. Typical
examples concern him more than rare specimens&mdash;examples
which mark a stage in the progress of art, and about which there
is no possibility of learned dispute. He wants to know what has
been done in order to judge what may be done, and especially
he wants to know the best that has been done.</p>

<p>The problem is how to produce the best glass we can in
harmony with the architecture to which it belongs, but without
especial regard to what happens to have been done during the
period to which the architecture of the building belongs. We
may even inspire ourselves at the sources of sixteenth century
Italian art, and yet in no wise follow in the footsteps of the
glass painters of the period, who were more or less off the
track; we may set ourselves to do, not what they did (glass
was not their strong point), but what they might have done.
There, if you like, is an ideal worthy of the best of us.</p>

<p>If we pretend to be craftsmen we must do our work in the
best way we know. If we are men, let us at least be ourselves.
Let us work in the manner natural to us. If we undertake to
decorate a building with a style of its own, let us acknowledge
our obligation to it; let us be influenced by it so far as to
make our work harmonious with it&mdash;harmonious, that is to
say, in the eyes of an artist, not necessarily of a savant.
Evidence of modernity is no sin, but a merit, in modern work.
To see how a man adapted his design to circumstances not
those of his own day, gives interest to work. We never wander
so wide of the old medi√¶val spirit as when we pretend to be
medi√¶val or play at Gothic. True style, as craftsmen know,
consists in the character which comes of accepting quite
frankly the conditions inherent in our work.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIX.<br />
<br />
JESSE WINDOWS.</h3>

<p>The subjects depicted in stained glass tell the story of the
Church, or preach its doctrine. Scenes from the Old Testament,
from the Life of Christ, from the legends of the Saints, and
so on, recur from the earliest Gothic times, and throughout
the period of the Renaissance. These pictures accommodate
themselves to the current plans of design, or the plan of design
is chosen to suit them, as the case may be.</p>

<p>There is one subject, however, occurring from the first in
glass, which does not fall into any of the usual schemes of
design, and which, in fact, differs so entirely from any of
them, that it forms a class of design apart. The subject, in
fact, by way of exception to the rule, not merely affects but
determines the decorative form of the window. This subject
is the Descent of Christ&mdash;in short, the genealogical tree of the
Saviour; and the window devoted to its delineation is called
a Jesse window. Much freer and more varied scope for composition
was offered by this piece of church heraldry than
the ordinary medallion or figure and canopy window afforded,
and the glazier turned it early to exceedingly decorative use.
The tree is shown issuing, as it were, from the loins of Jesse.
It bears his descendants, or rather a very arbitrary selection
of them (it is as well not to inquire too strictly as to their
legitimate right to be there), ending in the Virgin and the
Saviour.</p>

<p>The earliest arrangement of a Jesse window is as follows:
at the base is the recumbent figure of Jesse; the straight
stem of the tree, proceeding from him, is almost entirely hidden
by a string of figures, one above the other, occupying the
centre part of the window, and represented, for the most part,
as Kings; above them is the Virgin, also crowned; and in
the arch of the window sits our Lord in Majesty, surrounded
by seven doves, to signify the gifts of the Spirit. It is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
perhaps quite clear upon what these figures sit. They hold on
with both hands to branches of highly conventional Romanesque
foliage, springing from the main stem, and occupying the space
about the figures in very ornamental fashion. A series of half
medallions on each side of this central design contain little
figures of attendant prophets&mdash;in a sense, the spiritual ancestors
of the Saviour. All this is in the deepest and richest mosaic
colour, as in the beautiful bluish Jesse window at the West end
of the cathedral at Chartres, which belongs to about the middle
of the twelfth century. Very much the same kind of thing
occurs at Le Mans and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Later the tree more often branched out into loops, forming
oval or vesical-shaped spaces, in which the figures sat, as may
be seen on <a href="#Fig_243">page 362</a>. The ground of the window is in that case
blue, the background of the figure ruby. Had it been red the
figures would probably have been upon blue. This particular
instance, by the way, is said to be of the twelfth century,
although the ornament has more the character of thirteenth
century work. You see also the doves referred to encircling
the figure sitting in Majesty, and the figures attendant upon
the Virgin. Sometimes these are prophets, sometimes angels;
sometimes they stand in little canopy niches, sometimes they
are in the midst of the foliage. The fragment from Salisbury
on <a href="#Fig_64">page 117</a> formed most probably part of a Jesse window.
The symbolic doves have often each a nimbus. A single dove
represents, of course, the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>A rather suggestive variation upon the orthodox Early scheme
occurs in a window at Carcassonne. Each of the three lights
is bordered with a rather geometric pattern. Within the border
the central light is designed much on the usual lines: Jesse
recumbent below, and above the figures of Kings, sitting each
in his own little vesical-shaped space formed by the growth
of the tree. In the sidelights, however, the Prophets are provided
with the very simplest canopies, one above the other.</p>

<p>An interesting arrangement is to be found in the clerestory of
the cathedral at Tours, where the central light of a window has a
Tree of Jesse, with the usual oval compartments, corresponding
with hexagon-shaped medallions in the two sidelights, in
which are depicted scenes presumably appropriate to the
subject; it is difficult to make them out with any certainty.</p>

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">243. PART OF EARLY JESSE WINDOW, MUS√âE DES ARTS D√âCORATIFS, PARIS.</span></p>

<p>Occasionally what seems at first sight a medallion window
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a><br /><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>resolves itself, as at S. Kunibert, Cologne, into a kind of
genealogical tree, enclosing subjects illustrative of the descent
of Christ. The rather unusual combination of medallion and
vine shown <a href="#Fig_244">below</a>, also German, is of rather later date.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 173px;">
<a id="Fig_244" name="Fig_244"></a>
<img src="images/fig_244.png" width="173" height="250" alt="Freiburg" title="Freiburg" />
<span class="caption">244. <span class="smcap">Freiburg.</span></span>
</div>

<p>In the fourteenth century the tree naturally becomes a vine, usually in
colour upon a blue or ruby ground, extending beyond the limits of a
single light, and crossing not only the mullions, but the borders
(which, by the way, often confuse the effect of a Decorated Jesse
window). The vine extends also very often into the tracery, where sits
the Virgin with the Infant Christ. The figure of our Lord is always, of
course, the topmost feature of the tree&mdash;in the arms of the Virgin,
in the lap of the Father, or sitting in Majesty. A variation upon
ordinary practice occurs where the Father supports a crucifix. The
figure of Jesse naturally, as at Shrewsbury (<a href="#Fig_171">page 241</a>), extends across
several lights.</p>

<p>Occasionally a figure and canopy window proves to be also
a Jesse window&mdash;a vine, that is to say, winds about the figures,
and connects them with the figure of Jesse; but this combination
of canopy work with tree work (as at Wells, some of the
detail of which is given <a href="#Fig_245">overleaf</a>) is confused and confusing.
A much happier combination of figures under canopies with
tree work occurs in a sixteenth century window at S. Godard,
Rouen, which has at the base a series of five figures, above
whom spreads the tree, its roots appearing above the head of
the central one, who proves to be Jesse.</p>

<p>By the fifteenth century the vine is rather more conventionally
treated. It is usually in white and stain upon a
coloured ground, or, if the leaves are green, the stems are
white and stain. The figures also have more white in their
drapery. In the earlier part of the century the main stem
branches very often in an angular manner so as to form six-sided
bowers for the figures, framing them, perhaps, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
different colour from the general groundwork of the window. Or the
various lights of the window may have alternately a blue and a ruby
ground. It is rarely that two figures are shown in the width of a single
light, either in separate compartments or grouped in one.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 292px;">
<a id="Fig_245" name="Fig_245"></a>
<img src="images/fig_245.png" width="292" height="500" alt="Part of a Jesse Window" title="Part of a Jesse Window" />
<span class="caption">245. <span class="smcap">Part of a Jesse Window, Wells.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Later the tree, oftenest in white and stain, branches more freely, not
twisting itself any longer into set shapes or obvious compartments. The
figures are, as it were, perched amongst its branches. In French and
German work the tree, towards the sixteenth century, is not so
necessarily a vine. It may take the form more of scrollwork, white or
yellow, and the personages in its midst may be only demi-figures,
issuing possibly from vase-like flowers or flower-like ornament.</p>

<p>That is so in a remarkably fine window in the clerestory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
the cathedral at Troyes (three lights of which are shown on
<a href="#Fig_246">page 366</a>), where the figures no longer occupy the centre of the
lights, but are scattered about from side to side, balanced in a
very satisfactory way by their names writ large upon the background.
This characteristic lettering gives not only interesting
masses of white or yellow on the ruby ground, but horizontal
lines of great value to the composition. In the lower part of
the window a separate screen of richest yellow marks off the
figure of Jesse, and at the same time distinguishes the Donors,
together with their family and their armorial bearings, from
the merely scriptural part of the design. In earlier windows,
it should have been stated, prominence is sometimes given to
the really more important personages by drawing them to a
much larger scale, or by showing them full-length when the
others are only half-length, or by draping them all in white
and stain, whilst the rest are in colours not so strongly relieved
against the ground.</p>

<p>There are two other rather unusual Jesse windows at
Troyes, both of Late Gothic period. The one is at S. Nizier:
there the foliage is so rare as to give the effect almost of a
leafless scroll. The other is at S. Nicholas: there the tree
grows through into the tracery, where it appears no longer,
as in the lights below, upon a deep blue ground, but upon
yellow, the radiance, as it proves, from the group of the Trinity,
into which the tree eventually blossoms.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 254px;">

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">246. PART OF A JESSE WINDOW, CATHEDRAL, TROYES, 1499.</span></p>

<p>Quite one of the most beautiful Jesse trees that exist is in
a Late Gothic window at Alen√ßon. It is unusual, probably
unique in design. The figures, with the exception of Jesse, are
confined to the upper lights and tracery, forming a double row
towards the top of the window. This leaves a large amount
of space for the tree, a fine, fat, Gothic scroll, foliated more
after the manner of oak than acanthus leaves, all in rich greens
(yellowish, apple, emerald-like) on a greyish-blue ground. It
forms a splendid patch of cool colour, contrasting in the most
beautiful way with the figures, draped mostly in purple, red,
and yellow. The figures issue from great flower-like features
as big as the width of the light allows, mostly of red, or purple,
or white, with a calyx in green. The Virgin issues from a
white flower suggestive of the lily. In the window shown on
<a href="#Fig_247">page 368</a> the tree blossoms also into a topmost lily supporting
the Madonna. A characteristic feature about the Alen√ßon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a><br /><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>window is, the absence of symmetry in its scheme. Of the
eight lights which go to make up its width, only three are
devoted, below the springing of the great arch over it, to the
Jesse tree. Three others contain a representation of the death
of the Virgin, under a separate canopy, and in the two outermost
lights are separate subjects on a smaller scale. This
kind of eccentricity of composition is by no means unusual.
A Jesse window very often occupies only one half or one
quarter of a large Late Gothic window. And the strange
thing is that the effect is invariably satisfactory, often delightful.
You do not miss the symmetry, but enjoy the accidental
variety of colour.</p>

<p>In sixteenth century work, and even before that, you meet
with windows in which figures are in colours upon a white
ground. In that case the tree is usually painted upon the
white and stained. So it was in the beautiful Flemish window,
parts of which are now dispersed over the East windows of
S. George&#8217;s, Hanover Square, calculated, there, rather to
mystify the student of design. In it the grapes, it will be
seen (<a href="#Fig_159">page 216</a>), are glazed in purple pot-metal colour. In the
present condition of the window, now that the enamel-brown has
partly peeled off, the grape bunches scarcely seem to belong to
the rather ghostly vine behind them. That is a misfortune
which not uncommonly happens where reliance has been
placed upon delicate painting; but for all that this is noble
glass, and the figures, as was also not uncommon at the period,
are designed with great dignity.</p>

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">247. JESSE WINDOW, BEAUVAIS.</span></p>

<p>There is distinction, again, in the drawing of the figures in
the Jesse at S. Etienne, Beauvais, shown on <a href="#Fig_247">page 368</a>. That
is a splendid specimen of characteristically Renaissance work.
Jesse is honoured by a rich canopy of white and stain, which
allows of a deep purple background separating him from his
descendants. These appear as demi-figures, very richly robed,
in strong relief against a pale purplish-blue ground of the
atmospheric quality peculiar to the period. The vase-shaped
flowers whence they issue are also in rich colour, dark against
the ground, as are the variegated fruits and green leaves of the
tree, but its branches are of silvery-white, suggesting of birch-bark.
This tree-trunk is altogether too realistically treated
for the ornamental leafage and still more arbitrary flowers
growing from it; but it is a marvellously fine window, masterly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a><br /><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>in drawing and perfectly painted. And it owes positively
nothing to age or accident. Indeed, the effect is somewhat
diluted by restoration. Even on the reduced scale of the illustration
given, you can detect in the head of the hatless figure
to the right a touch of modern French character; and the fine
colour of it all is fine in spite of the flatness of tint in the
background, for which the nineteenth century must be held
responsible.</p>

<p>Except for the confusion caused by the occasional introduction
of canopies and borders, a Jesse window may be usually
recognised at a glance. In the cathedral at Troyes, however,
is what might be mistaken, at first sight, for a Jesse tree. But
the recumbent figure is not that of Jesse, but of Christ. He
lies, in fact, in the wine press, whence grows a vine bearing
half effigies of the Twelve Apostles, and the patron saints of
the Donor and his wife, who themselves had places in the
lower portion of the sidelights, but the figure of the wife is now
missing. The general design and effect of this window, and
especially the seriousness of the ornamental portion of it, are
such as almost to belie the period of its execution. It is an
exceptionally fine window for the year 1625.</p>

<p>This same subject is anticipated in a sixteenth century
window (1552) at Conches. There the Saviour treads the
blue grapes, and a stream of blood-red wine issues from them.
The frame of the press immediately behind him is designed to
suggest the cross.</p>

<p>The Jesse window referred to in the north transept at
Carcassonne is balanced by a window on the south, which is of
peculiarly interesting design, not, to my knowledge, elsewhere
to be found in glass, although it occurs in Early Italian
painting. It represents the Tree of Life, of Knowledge of Good
and Evil&mdash;which knowledge appears to be inscribed all over it
and the window. It might almost be described as a tree of
lettering, for it bears upon its branches (which are labels) and
upon its fruit (which are heart-shaped tablets) voluminous
inscriptions, not, in the present state of the glass, always easy
to decipher, but most effectively decorative. On either side
the window, by way of border to the outer lights, is a series
of little figures, prophets, or whoever they may be, bearing
other inscribed scrolls, mingling with the boughs of the tree,
the leaves of which form, as it were, a kind of green and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
yellow fringe to the inscribed white branches. At the foot of
the tree stand Adam and Eve, in the act of yielding to the
temptation of the woman-headed serpent coiled round its trunk,
and beyond are shown the Ark of Noah and the Ark of the
Covenant. Amidst the upper branches is a crucifix, the narrow
red cross so inconspicuous that the Christ seems almost to
hang upon the tree, and at its summit is the emblem of the
pelican, <i>Qui sanguine pascit alumnos</i>. This is altogether not only
a striking, and, at the same time, most satisfactory window,
but an admirable instance of the use of lettering in ornament.
Lettering is very often introduced into Jesse windows, and
forms sometimes a conspicuous feature in them: how much
more use might be made of it is suggested by this Tree of Life.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXX.<br />
<br />
STORY WINDOWS.</h3>

<p>There is something very interesting in the simple heartedness
with which the medi√¶val artist would attack a subject quite
impossible of artistic realisation, apart from his modest powers
of draughtsmanship, or the limitations of glass.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 126px;">
<a id="Fig_248" name="Fig_248"></a>

<span class="caption">248. <span class="smcap">The Temptation, Fairford.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The daring of the man may be taken as evidence of his
sincerity. If he had not believed absolutely in the things he
tried to pourtray, he could not have set them forth so simply
as he did, not only in the quite archaic medallions of the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries, but even in pictures conceived at the
end of what we call the Middle Ages. It would be impossible
nowadays to picture Paradise, as in the scene of the Temptation
at Fairford (<a href="#Fig_248">overleaf</a>), with its bald architecture and little
Gothic fountain, to say nothing of the serpent. But down to
the sixteenth century no subject was impossible to the designer.
Even the Creation did not deter him; on the contrary, it was
a favourite subject in old glass, throughout the medi√¶val
period (<a href="#Fig_174">page 252</a>): there is no shirking the difficulty of rendering
the division of light from the darkness, or the separation
of the waters from the dry land. Indeed, problems such as
these are sometimes solved with very remarkable ingenuity,
if not quite in a way to satisfy us: the Creator in the likeness
of a Pope, triple crown and all, as at Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne, was
pictured no doubt in all good faith and reverence.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most daring notions ever put into
stained glass occurs in a window in All Saints&#8217; Church, North
Street, York. The design illustrates an old Northumbrian
legend called &#8220;The Pryck of Conscience,&#8221; and boldly sets out
to show&mdash;the fishes roaring, the sea a-fire, a bloody dew, and,
as a climax, the general conflagration of the world. &#8220;Of heaven
and hell I have no power to tell,&#8221; wrote the &#8220;idle singer&#8221;
(as he most wilfully miscalled himself) of this perhaps &#8220;empty
day.&#8221; It was left to the modern artist to discover that.</p>

<p>The subject most frequently affected by the designer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
the West window of a Gothic church was &#8220;The Last Judgment,&#8221; in which
appeared our Lord in Majesty, St. Michael weighing human souls, angels
welcoming the righteous into heaven, and fiends carrying off the doomed
to hell. These &#8220;Doom&#8221; windows, as they are also called, are not, to the
modern mind, impressive&mdash;not, that is to say, as the pictures of
reward and punishment hereafter they were meant to be. The scene strikes
us invariably as grotesque rather than terrible, actual as it may have
been to the simple artist, who meant to be a sober chronicler, and to
the yet simpler worshippers to whom he addressed himself.</p>

<p>Apart from that, &#8220;Last Judgment&#8221; windows are among the most interesting
in the church. The portion of the window, in particular, which is
devoted to perdition is most attractive. Hell flames offered to the
artist a splendid opportunity for colour, upon which he seized with
delight. And the fiends he imagined! Doubtless those crude conceptions
of his were very real to him, convincing and terror-striking. The grim
humour which we see in them may be of our own imagining; but that the
draughtsman enjoyed his creations no artist will doubt.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 275px;">
<a id="Fig_249" name="Fig_249"></a>

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">249. PART OF LAST JUDGMENT, FAIRFORD.<br />
<small>J. Akerman, Photo-lith, London, W.&nbsp;C.</small></span></p>

<p>That is easy to understand. His subject allowed him freedom of
imagination, gave him scope for fancy, humour, colour; and all his
faculties found outlet. No wonder his would-be fiends live beautiful in
our recollection! In the midst of ruby flames dance devils, purple,
black, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a><br />
<a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span> brown, gnashing carnivorous teeth or yellow fangs, their
beady, white eyes gleaming with cruelty. Devils there are apparently
red-hot; others green and grey, with a beautiful but unholy kind of
iridescence about them. As for the blue devils, they are beautiful
enough to scare away from the beholder blue devils less tangible, which
may have had possession of him. There is a great white devil in a window
at Strassburg, who has escaped, it seems, from the Doom window near by,
but not from the flames about him, a background of magnificent ruby. The
drawing of a part of the Last Judgment from Fairford (<a href="#Fig_249">page 373</a>) gives
only the grotesqueness of the scene, the quaintly conceived tortures of
the damned; but that division of the glass is in reality a glory of
gorgeous colour, to which one is irresistibly attracted. For that, as
ever, the designer has reserved his richest and most glowing colour.</p>

<p>Some slight touch of human perversity perhaps inspires him
also. At Fairford, at all events, he has put some of his best
work, and especially some of his finest colour, into the figures
of the Persecutors of the Church. Unfortunately, they are
high up in the clerestory, and so do not get their share of
attention; certainly they do not get the praise they deserve.
Why, one is inclined to ask, this honour to the enemies of the
Church on the part of the churchman? Was he at heart
a heathen giving secret vent in art to feelings he dared not
openly express? Not a bit of it! He was just a trifle tired
of Angels, and Saints, and subjects according to convention;
he was delighted at the chance of doing something not quite
tame and same, and revelled in the opportunity when it
occurred. In the tracery openings above the persecutors,
where in the ordinary way would be angels, are lodged much
more appropriate little fiends. They haunt the memory long
after you have seen them, not as anything very terrific, but
as bits of beautiful colour. The Devil <a href="#Fig_250">overleaf</a>, hovering in
wait for the soul of the impenitent thief upon the cross,
is not by any means a favourable specimen of the Fairford
fiends.</p>

<p>Occasionally there is a grimness about the medi√¶val Devil
which we feel to this day.  In a window at S. Etienne,
Beauvais, there is a quite unforgettable picture of a woman
struggling in the clutches of the evil one. She is draped
in green, the Devil is of greenish-white, the architecture is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
represented in a gloom of purple and dark blue; only a peep of
pale sky is seen through the window. On the one hand, this
is a delightful composition of decorative colour. On the other
it is intensely dramatic. It sets one wondering who this may
be, and what will be the outcome of it. The struggle is
fearful, the fiend is quite frantic in action. One is so taken
with the scene that one does not notice that his head is
wanting, and has been replaced by one which does not even fit
his shoulders. That the effect, for all that, is impressive,
speaks volumes for the story-teller.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 239px;">
<a id="Fig_250" name="Fig_250"></a>
<img src="images/fig_250.png" width="239" height="250" alt="Fairford" title="Fairford" />
<span class="caption">250. <span class="smcap">Fairford.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Alas, alas, the Devil is dead! His modern counterfeit is a fraud. You
may see this at the church of S. Vincent, at Rouen, in one of the
subjects representing the life of that saint, where he puts the devils
to flight. The nearest of them is an evil-looking thing, ruby coloured,
uncannily spotted, like some bright poisonous-looking fungus. The
restorer has supplemented these retreating devils by a farther one
painted on the grey-blue sky. The imp is grotesque enough, and very
cleverly put in, but it plainly belongs no longer to the early sixteenth
century. It suggests a theatrical &#8220;property,&#8221; not the hobgoblin of old
belief. That is just what the devilry in old glass never does.</p>

<p>It must be owned that medi√¶val Angels charm us less.
They are by comparison tame. Their colour is delicate and
silvery, belike, but not seductive; their wings sit awkwardly
upon them; they fulfil more or less trivial functions, bearing
scrolls or emblems, shields of arms even. They are not in
the least ethereal. They are too much on the model of man
or woman. What possible business, for example, have they
with legs and feet? Yet it is by the rarest chance that the
body is, as it were, lost in a swirl of drapery, which, by
disguising the lower limbs, makes the image by so much,
if not the more angelic, at least the less obviously of the
earth.</p>

<p>The glass hunter cannot but be amused every now and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
again by odd anachronisms in medi√¶val and even later illustrations
in glass. But wonder at them ceases when we
remember how simple-minded was the craftsman of those
days before arch√¶ology. If he wished to picture scenes of
the long past&mdash;and he did&mdash;there was nothing for it but
to show them as they occurred to his imagination&mdash;as
happening, that is to say, in his own day; and that is
practically what he did. He had perhaps a vague notion
that a Roman soldier should wear a kilt; but in the main he
was content that the onlookers at the Crucifixion should be
costumed according to the period of William the Conqueror,
or Maximilian, in which he himself happened to live. The
practice had, at least, one advantage over our modern displays
of probably very inaccurate learnedness, in that it brought the
scene close home to the unlearned observer, and, as it were,
linked the event with his own life. In short, there is more
vitality in that rude story-telling than in the more elaborate
histories, much less inaccurate in detail doubtless, to which
to-day and henceforth artists are pledged.</p>

<p>There is no occasion to dwell upon the oddities of glass
painting; they are those of medi√¶val art all through. If we
take a certain incongruity for granted, the guilelessness of
it only charms us. That same guilelessness enables the artist
to make absolutely ornamental use of themes which to-day we
might think it profane to make subservient to decorative effect.
We never question his sincerity, though in the scene of the
Creation, as at Erfurth, he made a pattern of the birds, pair and
pair, each on its own tree. He can safely show the staff of
S. Christopher, as at Freiburg, blossoming so freely as conveniently
to fill the head of the window and balance the Child
upon his shoulder. According as it occurs to him, or as it
suits his purpose, kings and bishops take part in the Crucifixion;
S. Michael tramples upon a dragon big enough to
swallow him at a mouthful; Abraham goes out, gorgeously
arrayed in red and purple, to slaughter Isaac on a richly
decorated altar, and a white ram, prancing among the green,
calls his attention to itself as the more appropriate sacrifice;
Adam and Eve are driven forth from Eden by a scarlet angel,
draped in white, with wings as well as sword of flaming red.
In this last case the peculiar colour has a significance. Elsewhere
it implies the poverty of the glazier&#8217;s palette, or indicates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
the sacrifice of natural to artistic effect. So it was that, till
quite the end of the thirteenth century, we meet with positively
blue beards, ruby cows, and trees of all the colours of the
rainbow; and even at a much later date than that, primary-coloured
cattle look over the manger at the Nativity, and
Christ is shown entering Jerusalem on a bright blue donkey.</p>

<p>To the last the glass painter indulged in very interesting
compound subjects&mdash;the Nativity, for example, with in the
distance the Magi on their way; the Last Supper, and in the
foreground, relieved against the tablecloth, Christ washing
Peter&#8217;s feet, the apostles grouped round so as to form part of
each or either subject. Sometimes a series of events form
a single picture, as where you have the Temptation, the
Expulsion, Eve with her distaff, Adam with his spade, the
childhood of Cain and Abel, and the first fratricide, all grouped
in one comprehensive landscape.</p>

<p>Consecutive pictures, by the way, generally follow in horizontal
not vertical series, beginning on your left as you face
the window. There is no invariable rule; but in most cases
the order of the subjects is from left to right, row after row,
terminating at the top of the window.</p>

<p>From the beginning difficult doctrinal subjects are attempted,
as well as histories and legends. In the sixteenth century
the design is often an allegory, full of meaning, though the
meaning of it all may not be very obvious. The Virtues,
for example, no longer content to stand under canopies,
systematically spearing each its contrasting Vice, harness
themselves, as at S. Patrice, Rouen, to a processional car,
in which are the Virgin, Christ upon the Cross, and sundry
vases, preceded by the Patriarchs and other holy personages.
Another interesting &#8220;morality,&#8221; at S. Vincent, Rouen, is pictured
in a medley of little figures each with descriptive label&mdash;&#8220;Richesse,&#8221;
for example, a lady in gorgeous golden array;
&#8220;Pitie,&#8221; a matron of sober aspect; &#8220;Les Riches Ingrass,&#8221;
a group of gay young men; &#8220;Le Riche&#8221; and &#8220;Le Poure,&#8221;
alike pursued by death. Another decorative device of the
sixteenth century is the Virgin, lifesize, surrounded by her
emblems and little white scrolls describing them&mdash;&#8220;Fons
ortorum,&#8221; &#8220;Sivit as Dei,&#8221; and so on, in oddly spelt Latin.
This occurs at Conches.</p>

<p>In Later Gothic, and of course in Renaissance glass, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
situation is, if not realised, at all events dramatically treated.
One scarcely knows to which period to attribute the window
at S. Patrice, Rouen, with scenes from the life of S. Louis,
an admirably sober and serious piece of work. Conspicuous in
it is the recurring mantle of the King, deep indigo coloured,
embroidered with golden <i>fleurs-de-lys</i>, on an inky-blue ground.
The whole effect is rich but strikingly low in tone. An exceptionally
fine scene is that in which the King, in a golden boat with
white sails, ermine diapered, a crown upon his head, kneels in
prayer before a little crucifix, whilst his one companion lifts
up his hands in terror: the man is clad in green; for the rest
the colour is sombre, only the pale blue armour of the Saint,
his dark blue cloak, for once undiapered&mdash;as if the artist felt
that here the golden lilies would be out of place&mdash;and the
leaden sea around: that extends to the very top of the picture,
distant ships painted upon it to indicate that it is water. An
inscription explains how:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">&#8220;En revenant du pays de Syrie</span>
<span class="i0">En mer fut tourmente ... gde furie</span>
<span class="i0">Mais en priant Jesu Christ il en fut delivr√©.&#8221;</span>
</div>

<p>It must be allowed that the storm does not rage very terrifically;
but the effect is not merely beautiful as colour but really
descriptive, and something more.</p>

<p>It is only occasionally that this much of dramatic effect is
produced; but touches of well-studied realism are common, as
where, in the same church, at the martyrdom of a saint, the
executioners who feed the fire shrink from the yellow flames
and guard their eyes.</p>

<p>Decorative treatment goes almost without saying in the early
sixteenth century. At S. Patrice, again, is a singularly fine
instance of that. In the centre of the window, against a background
of forest, with the distant hunt in full cry, S. Eustache
stands entranced, his richly clad figure a focus of bright colour;
facing him, in the one light, the legendary stag, enclosing
between its antlers the vision of the crucifix, balanced, in the
other, by the white horse of the convert: the note of white is
repeated in the lithe hounds running through the three lights,
and, with the silvery trunks of the trees, holds the composition
together. This subject of the Conversion of S. Hubert
was rather a favourite one in glass, and was usually well treated.
The stag is invaluable. At Erfurth he stands against the green,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
a mass of yellow, with purple antlers, which form a vesica-shaped
frame for the fabled vision.</p>

<p>The use of white, by the way, as a means of holding the
window together is remarkable throughout Later glass, even
apart from white canopy work. In the cathedral at Perugia
there is a window in which a stream of white pavement flows,
as it were, down through the groups of richly coloured figures,
emphasising them, and at the same time connecting them with
the canopy.</p>

<p>There is no end to the interest of subject in glass; but the
subject would lead us too far astray from the purpose of this
book. Enough has been said to indicate the kind of interest
which each of us best finds for himself in glass hunting.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXI.<br />
<br />
HOW TO SEE WINDOWS.</h3>

<p>The just appreciation of stained glass is more than difficult,
and judgment with regard to it more than ordinarily fallible.
It is too much to expect of a window that it should stand the
test of a light for which it was not designed. The most conscientious
artist can do no more than design it for the light by
which he imagines it is most likely to be seen. There must
inevitably be times of day, when the sun is in a position not
favourable to it, and many days when the intensity of the light,
even though it come from the right quarter, is not what he relied
upon. It happens, of course, that glass is often seen under
such conditions that the brilliancy of the windows on one side
of the church is literally put out by a flood of light poured in
upon them through the windows (brilliantly illuminated by it)
on the opposite side. The best of critics could not appreciate
the best of glass under circumstances like that.</p>

<p>Suppose the windows north and south of a church to be
of equal merit, one&#8217;s appreciation of them, at first sight, would
depend upon the time of day; and the light which did most
justice to the northern windows would do least to the southern,
and <i>vice vers√¢</i>. Experience teaches a man to make allowances,
but he can only judge what he has seen; and it is only with
the light shining through a window that he can see its colour
or judge of its effect.</p>

<p>The wonderful difference which the strength of the light
makes in the appearance of a window, is nowhere quite so
obvious as in the case of windows, not of glass, but of translucent
alabaster&mdash;as, for example, at Orvieto, in the lower
lights on either side of the nave, or, framed in black marble
mullions, at the West end of the cathedral. The more or less
square-shaped slabs of which they are formed are, in very
many cases, made up of a number of pieces cemented together
in lines which take very much the place of lead lines, and
suggest, with the bars holding them in place, the practice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
the glazier; but the effect is much less that of glass than of
deepest amber in the unbroken panels, of gorgeous tortoise-shell
in those that are patched and pieced together. These
last are, if not the more beautiful, certainly the more interesting.
The brown and gold and horny-white grow murkier
when the light does not shine full upon the windows; but there
is a mystery about the colour still, which makes up for the loss
of brilliancy. If your mood is that way, you may find in the
curious marbling of the stone strange pictures of cloudland
and fantastic landscape. It is partly the shape, no doubt, of
a circular slab high above the western door, which calls to
mind the image of the moon with its mysterious mountains.</p>

<p>A more delicate, if not always so rich an effect, is to be seen
in the great monolithic slabs which fill the five square-headed
windows in the apse of the upper church at S. Miniato.
Effect, did I say? Nay, rather effects, for they change with
every gradation in the light. You may see at first little more
than flat surfaces of pleasantly mottled white and purple-grey,
translucent, but comparatively dull and dead. Then, as the
sun creeps round the corner, a strange life comes into them.
The white and palest greys begin to glow, and turn by slow
degrees to pearly-pink, which kindles into gold, and deepens in
the duskier parts to copper-red. The stronger markings of
the stone now show out in unsuspected strength, and the
lighter veins take on by contrast a greenish tint, so that the
warm colour is subtly shot with its cool counterpart. If, when
you first see the windows, the sun illumines them, the effect
is less magical; you get your strongest impression first; but
in the course of an hour or so a great change may take place&mdash;when,
for example, towards noon the light passes away; but
for a long while the stone remains luminous. Your eyes are
open now, and in the delicate ashen-grey you see&mdash;or is it that
you feel it to be there?&mdash;a tint of rose.</p>

<p>In proportion as it is less opaque than alabaster, glass is
less perceptibly affected by changes of light; but, whether we
perceive it or not, it owes all its effect to the light shining
through it. The most fair-minded of us misjudge windows
because we cannot see them often enough to be quite sure we
have seen them at their best&mdash;that is to say, on the right day,
and at the right time of day.</p>

<p>In comparing one window with another we are more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
ever likely to do injustice. Even if they happen to be both
in the same church, the light most favourable to the one may,
as just said, be quite the least favourable to the other. Each
must in fairness be judged at its best; and it is no easy matter
to compare to-day&#8217;s impression with yesterday&#8217;s, or it may be
last week&#8217;s&mdash;more especially when a newer impression of the
same thing, staring you in the face, will stamp itself upon the
vision. When years, instead of days, intervene, the justice of
even the most retentive memory is open to gravest doubt.</p>

<p>Go to the church of S. Alpin, at Ch√¢lons, and in the morning
you will find the East windows brilliantly rich: in the early
afternoon, even of a bright day, they will be lacking in transparency,
dull, ineffective. So at S. Sebald&#8217;s, Nuremberg, the
splendid fourteenth century glass on the north side of the choir
proves absolutely obscure in the late afternoon. Grisaille,
which was delicate under a moderately subdued light, will
appear thin and flimsy with a strong sun behind it. It has
happened to me to describe the same glass on one occasion as
too heavily, on another as too thinly painted; and, again, to
describe a window as warm in tone which memory (and my
notes) had painted cool. On another occasion, well-remembered
windows were not to be identified again. It seemed that in
the course of a few intervening years they must have been
restored out of all knowledge; a few hours later in the day
there was no mistaking them, though they had, indeed, lost
something by restoration.</p>

<p>When the most careful and deliberate notes tell such
different, and indeed quite opposite, stories, notes made at
times not far enough apart to allow for anything like a
complete change of opinion on the part of the critic, it is
clear that conditions of light go so far towards the effect of
glass, that it is quite impossible to appraise it fairly the first
time one sees it. The more momentary the impression on
which one has to found an opinion, the more essential it is
that we should choose the moment. The strongest light is by
no means the most favourable to glass. In a glare of sunlight
it is quite probable that some unhappy windows will have
more light shining upon than comes through the glass.
Happiest are the windows seen by &#8220;the subdued light of a
rainy day.&#8221; Occasionally a window, so deep that under
ordinary conditions of light it is obscure, may need the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
strongest possible illumination; but even in the case of very
deep-toned windows&mdash;such, for example, as those in the transepts
of the Duomo at Florence&mdash;the glass, as a whole, is best
seen by a sober light. You get the maximum of colour effect
with the minimum of hurt to any individual window, if there
be any hurt at all. A really garish window may be beautiful
as the light wanes. The great North Rose at Notre Dame
(Paris) is impressive at dusk.</p>

<p>Other conditions upon which the effect of glass largely
depends are quite beyond our control. As a matter of fact, we
rarely see it at its best. For one thing, we do not see it in
sufficient quantity. We find it in here and there a window
only, white light shining unmitigated from windows all round.
Perhaps in the window itself there is a breakage, and a stream
of light pours through it, spoiling, if not its beauty, all enjoyment
of it. It is not generally understood how completely the
effect of glass depends upon the absence of light other than
that which comes through it. Every ray of light which penetrates
into a building excepting through the stained glass does
injury to the coloured window; more often than not, therefore,
we see it under most adverse circumstances. It is worse than
hearing a symphony only in snatches; it is rather as if a more
powerful orchestra were all the while drowning the sound. It
takes an expert to appreciate glass when light is reflected upon
it from all sides. The effect of some of the finest glass in
Germany, as at Munich and Nuremberg, is seriously marred by
a wicked German practice of filling only the lower half of the
window with coloured glass and glazing the upper part in white
rounds. That enables folk to read their Bibles, no doubt; but
the volume of crude white light above goes far to kill the colour
of the glass. In such case it is not until you have shut off the
offending light that it is possible to enjoy, or even to appreciate,
the windows.</p>

<p>A comparatively dark church is essential to the perfect
enjoyment of rich glass. The deep red light-absorbing sandstone
of which Strassburg and Shrewsbury Cathedrals are built,
adds immensely to the brilliancy of their beautiful glass.</p>

<p>White light is the most cruel, but not the only, offender. Old
glass sometimes quarrels with old glass. An Early window is
made to look heavy by a quantity of Late work about it, and a
Late window pales in the presence of deep rich Early glass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
As for modern work, it is that which suffers most by comparison
with old; but it arouses often a feeling of irritation in us which
puts us out of the mood to enjoy.</p>

<p>Worst offence of all is that done in the name of restoration,
where, inextricably mixed up with old work, is modern forgery;
not clever enough to pass for old, but sufficiently like it to cast
a doubt upon the genuine work, at the same time that it quite
destroys its beauty.</p>

<p>Something of our appreciation depends upon the frame of
mind in which we come to the windows. They may be one
of the sights of the place; but the sight-seeing mood is not the
one in which to appreciate. How often can the tourist sit
down in a church with the feeling that he has all the day
before him, and can give himself up to the enjoyment of the
glass, wait till it has something to say to him? A man has
not seen glass when he has walked round the church, with one
eye upon it and the other on his watch, not even though he
may have made a note or two concerning it. You must give
yourself up to it, or it will never give up to you the secret of
its charm.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXII.<br />
<br />
WINDOWS WORTH SEEING.</h3>

<p>The course of the glass hunter seems never yet to have been
clearly mapped out for him. Nor can he depend upon those
who pretend to direct his steps. The enthusiastic description
of the monograph proves in the event to have very likely no
warrant of art; the paragraph in the guide-book is so cold as
to excite no spark of curiosity about what may be worth every
effort to see. Between the two a beginner stands uncertain
which way to turn, and as often as not goes astray.</p>

<p>The question which perplexes him on the very outskirts of the
subject is: Which are the windows to see? That depends. Some
there are which every one who cares at all about glass should
certainly see, some which the student who really wants to know
should study, some which the artist should see, if merely for the
satisfaction of his colour sense. To enumerate only a single
class of these would be to write a catalogue; but catalogues
are hard reading; the more interesting and more helpful
course will be, to tell shortly of some of the windows best
worth seeing, and why they should be seen. And if choice be
made of instances typical enough to illustrate the history of
glass, the list may serve as an itinerary to such as may think
it worth while to study it, as it should be studied, not in books,
but in churches.</p>

<p>Churches favourable to the study of Early glass in England
are not very many. A series of thirteenth century windows is
rare; and good examples, such as the fragments from the
S. Chapelle, at South Kensington, are few and far between. The
one fine series of medallion windows is at Canterbury Cathedral,
in the round-headed lights of the choir. In the clerestory also
is some figure work, on a larger scale, but less admirable of its
kind. For good thirteenth century grisaille in any considerable
quantity one must go to Salisbury, where, fortunately, the aisle
windows are near enough to the eye to show the very characteristic
patterns of the glass. To sit there in the nave and wait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a><br />
<a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
until service is over, is no hardship even to the most ardent
glass hunter. The silvery light from the windows facing him
at the East end of the aisles is solace and delight enough. Yet
more enchanting is the pale beauty of the Five slim Sisters, in
the North transept of York Minster; that, however, is gained, to
some extent, by the confusion of the pattern, which is not quite
typically Early, but begins to show symptoms of a transition
stage in design.</p>

<p>To appreciate at its full value the stronger colour of the Early
mosaic glass one must cross the Channel. We have nothing in
this country to compare in quantity, and therefore for effect, with
the gorgeous glass illuminating the great French churches.
Reims, for example, Bourges, Le Mans, are perfect treasure
houses of jewelled light. But richer than all is Chartres. The
windows there are less conveniently placed for study than at
Le Mans, but they are grander, and more in number. At Reims
the art is coarser, though the magnificence of certain red
windows there lives in the memory. Emphatically Chartres is
the place to know and appreciate thirteenth century glass. No
other great church of the period retains so much of its original
glazing; and since it is one of the largest, and the glass is very
much of one period, it follows that no church contains so much
Early glass. The impression it produces is the more pronounced
that there is little else. Except for a modern window
or two, one Late Gothic window, and some four or five lights of
grisaille, which belong to the second period, the glass throughout
this vast building is typically Early. It is well worth a
pilgrimage to Chartres only to see it. You may wander about
the church for hours at a time, unravelling the patterns of the
windows, and puzzling out the subjects of the medallion pictures.
To sit there in more restful mood upon some summer
afternoon, when the light is softened by a gentle fall of rain, is
to be thrilled by the beauty of it all. It is as though, in a
dream, you found yourself in some huge cavern, lit only by the
light of jewels, myriads of them gleaming darkly through the
gloom. It is difficult to imagine anything more mysterious,
solemn, or impressive. Yes, Chartres is the place in which to
be penetrated by the spirit of Early medi√¶val glass. There is a
story told of a child sitting for the first time in his life in some
French church, awed by the great Rose window facing him,
when all at once the organ burst into music; and it seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
him, he said, as if the window spoke. Words could not better
express than that the powerful impression of Early mosaic glass,
the solemnity of its beauty, the way it belongs to the grandeur
of the great church, the something deep in us vibrating in
answer to it.</p>

<p>Exceptionally interesting Early glass is to be found in the
cathedral of Poitiers; but it is hurt by the white light from
other windows. In the case of Early coloured windows it is
more than ever true that their intensity can only be appreciated
when all the light in the building comes through them. That
intensity, as was said, is deepened where, as at Strassburg, the
colour of the walls absorbs instead of reflecting light. There the
red sandstone of which the church is built gives back so little
light that, as you enter the door, you step from sunshine into
twilight, in which the glass shines doubly glorious. Some of these
(certain of the Kings, for example, on the north side of the nave,
each with its huge nimbus eddying, as it were, ring by ring of
colour, out to the margin of the niche) are of the thirteenth if
not of the twelfth century; but they are typical of no period.
The borders framing them are perhaps a century later than the
figures. Indeed, the period of this glass is most perplexing to
the student of style, until he realises that, after the great fire
at the very end of the thirteenth century, remains of earlier glass,
spared from the wreck, were incorporated with the newer work.
And, not only this, but, what was rare in medi√¶val days, the
fourteenth century designer, in his endeavour to harmonise, as
he most successfully did, the old work with the new, gave to his
own work a character which was not of his period,&mdash;much to
the mystification of the student, who too readily imagines that
he cannot go far wrong in attributing to the glass in a church
a date posterior to its construction.</p>

<p>The cathedral at Strassburg is rich also in distinctly Decorated
glass, to all of which the tourist pays no heed. He
goes there to see the clock. If he should have a quarter of
an hour to spare before noon&mdash;at which hour the cock crows
and the church is shut&mdash;he allows himself to be driven by
the verger, with the rest of the crowd, into the transept, and
penned up there until the silly performance begins. To hear
folk talk of the thing afterwards at the <i>table d&#8217;h√¥te</i> you might
fancy that Erwin Von Steinbach had built his masterpiece
just to house this rickety piece of mock old mechanism.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>Some of the most interesting glass of the Middle Gothic period is to be
found in Germany, for tradition died hard there; and, whilst thirteenth
century glass was more often Romanesque than Gothic in character, that
of the fourteenth often followed closely the traditions of earlier
Gothic workmanship. The Germans excelled especially in foliage design,
which they treated in a manner of their own. It was neither very deep in
colour nor grisaille, but midway between the two. The glass at
Regensburg is an exceedingly good instance of this treatment; but
instances of it are to be found also in the Museum at Munich, very
conveniently placed for the purposes of study. The windows at Freiburg
in the Black Forest should also be seen. But some of the very richest
figure work of the period is to be found in the choir windows of S.
Sebald&#8217;s Church, at Nuremberg. Except for the simplicity of their lines
these are not striking in design; but the colour is perhaps deeper in
tone than in the very richest of thirteenth century glass. The first
impression is that the composition is entirely devoid of white glass;
but there proves to be a very small amount of horny-tinted material
which may be supposed to answer to that description. As the light fades
towards evening these windows become dull and heavy; but on a bright day
the intensity of their richness is unsurpassed. They have a quality
which one associates rather with velvet than with glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>Excellent Decorated glass, and a great quantity of it, is to be
found at Evreux, and again at Troyes. The clerestory of the
choir at Tours is most completely furnished with rich Early
Decorated glass of transitional character&mdash;interesting on that
account, and, at the same time, most beautiful to see. There
is other Decorated work there with which it is convenient to
compare it, together with earlier and later work more or less
worth seeing. Again most interesting work, but not much of
it, and that rather fragmentary, is to be found at the church of
S. Radegonde, at Poitiers; but there was in France at about
that time rather a lull in glass painting. In England, on the
contrary, there is an abundance of it. There is good work in
the choir of Wells Cathedral. Part of it is in a rather fragmentary
condition, but it is all very much of a period; and
there is enough of it to give a fair idea of what English Decorated
glass is like. York Minster is rich in it. It is quite an
object lesson in style to go straight from the contemplation of
the Five Sisters, which belong to the latter part of the Early
period of glass painting, into the neighbouring vestibule of the
Chapter House, where the windows are of the early years of
the Second Period, and thence to the Chapter House itself,
where they are typically Decorated. The study of Decorated
glass can be continued in the nave again, which is filled with it.
Entering, then, the choir, you find mainly Perpendicular glass,
much of it typical of English work of the Late Gothic period.</p>

<p>Other very beautiful Late Gothic work is to be found in
some of the smaller churches of York, such as All Saints&#8217;.
There is a window there made up of fragments of old glass,
among which are some very delicately painted and really
beautiful heads. This work is all characteristically English.
English also is the glass in the Priory Church at Great
Malvern. There is a vast quantity of it, too, which adds to its
effect; but unfortunately, a great part of it now fills windows
for which it was obviously not designed. This is the more
unfortunate because, where it has not been disturbed, it shows
unmistakable evidence of having been very carefully designed
for its place. The tracery of the great East window is, for
example, an admirable instance of the just balance between
white and colour so characteristic of later Gothic glass.
Again, the Creation window, amongst others, is a lesson in
delicate glass painting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 133px;">

<img src="images/fig_253.png" width="133" height="400" alt="Fairford" title="Fairford" />
<span class="caption">253. <span class="smcap">Fairford.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Distinctly English in the delicacy of their painting are, again, the
windows in the church of S. Mary, Ross. The far-famed windows of
Fairford are, of course, not English. They were captured, the story
goes, at sea, and brought to Gloucestershire, where a Perpendicular
church was built to accommodate them. English antiquaries make claim
that they are English, but internal evidence shows them to be Flemish or
German. Considerable notoriety attaches to the Fairford windows owing to
a theory which was at one time propounded to the effect that they were
designed by Albert D√ºrer. The theory is now as dead as a back number,
but the notoriety remains&mdash;and not undeservedly; for although this
glass stands by no means alone, and is distinctly second to some
contemporary work (such, for example, as that on the north side of the
nave of Cologne Cathedral, which D√ºrer might conceivably have designed),
it is remarkably fine; and it enjoys the comparatively rare distinction
of practically filling the windows of the church. You not only,
therefore, see the colour (which, rather than the painting, is its
charm) at its best, but you have a complete scheme of
decoration&mdash;Type answering to Anti-type, the Twelve Apostles
corresponding to the Prophets, the Evangelists to the Four Fathers, and
again</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
the Saints opposed to the Persecutors of the Church. Most old
glass owes something to the disintegration of its surface, and
the consequent refraction of the light transmitted through it.
In the Fairford glass the colours are more than usually mellow.
The white, in particular, is stained to every variety of green and
grey&mdash;the colour, as it proves, of the minute growth of lichen
with which it is overgrown. It is said that, when the fury of
iconoclasm was abroad, this glass was buried out of harm&#8217;s
way; which may possibly have hastened the decay of the
glass, and so have given root-hold for the growth which now
glorifies it.</p>

<p>It would not be easy to find finer instances of Late Gothic
German work than the five great windows on the North side
of Cologne Cathedral. There, too, one has only to turn right-about-face
to compare early sixteenth century with nineteenth
century German practice, and on precisely the same scale, too.
Any one who could hesitate for an instant to choose between
them, has everything yet to learn in regard both to glass and
to colour. The garish modern transparencies show, by their
obvious shortcomings, the consummate accomplishment of the
later Gothic glass painters.</p>

<p>There is a very remarkable late Gothic Jesse window in the
Lorenz Kirche at Nuremberg, and another almost equal to it
in the cathedral at Ulm. The Tree of Jesse is very differently,
but certainly not less beautifully, rendered in the fine West
window at Alen√ßon.</p>

<p>In most of the great French churches, and in many of the
smaller ones, you find good fifteenth century work. At Bourges
you have seven four-light windows and one larger one, all fairly
typical. The best of them is in the chapel of Jacques C&#339;ur,
the Jack that built at Bourges quite one of the most remarkable
of medi√¶val houses extant. But there is no one church
which recurs before all others to the memory when one thinks
of Late Gothic glass in France. One remembers more readily
certain superlative instances, such as the flamboyant Rose window
at the West end of S. Maclou, at Rouen, a wonder of rich
colour, or the Western Rose in the cathedral there. The fact
is, that the spirit of the Renaissance begins early in the sixteenth
century to creep into French work; and, as glass painting
arrives at its perfection, it betrays very often signs of going
over to the new manner. This is peculiarly the case in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
part of France which lies just this side of the Alps; so much
so, that a markedly mixed style is commonly accepted as
&#8220;Burgundian.&#8221; This is most apparent in the beautiful church
of Brou, a marvel of fanciful Gothic, florid, of course, after
the manner of the Early sixteenth century, extreme in its
ornamentation, but, for all but the purist, extremely beautiful.
The church itself is as rich as a jewel by Cellini, and
infinitely more interesting; and the glass is worthy of its
unique setting.</p>

<p>There is a very remarkable series of windows to see in the
cathedral at Auch, all of a period, all by one man, filling all
the eighteen windows of the choir ambulatory. Transition is
everywhere apparent in them, though perhaps one would not
have placed them quite so early as 1513, the date ascribed to
them. A notable thing about the work is its scale, which is much
larger than is usual in French glass of that period. Nowhere
will you find windows more simply and largely designed or
more broadly treated. Nowhere will you find big Renaissance
canopies richer in colour or more interesting in design. The
fifty or more rather fantastically associated Prophets, Patriarchs,
Sibyls, and Apostles depicted, form, with the architecture
about them and the tracery above, quite remarkable
compositions of colour. And it is very evident that the colour
of each window has been thought out as a whole. There is
not one of these windows which is not worth seeing. They
form collectively a most important link in the chain of style,
without, however, belonging to any marked period. Indeed,
they stand rather by themselves as examples of very Early
Renaissance work, aiming at broad effects of strong colour
(quite opposite from what one rather expects of sixteenth
century French work), and reaching it. And though the artist
works almost entirely in mosaic&mdash;using coloured glass, that
is to say, instead of pigment&mdash;and depends less than usual
upon painting, he yet lays his colour about the window in a
remarkably painter-like way.</p>

<p>There are noteworthy windows at Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne, in
the churches of SS. Madelaine and Joseph, which can be
claimed neither as Gothic nor Renaissance, details of each
period occurring side by side in the same window. At the
church of S. Alpin at Ch√¢lons is a series of picture windows
in grisaille, not often met with, and very well worth seeing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
Early sixteenth century glass is so abundant that it is hopeless
to specify churches. Nowhere is the transition period
better represented than at Rouen, and, for that matter, the
Early Renaissance too. The church of S. Vincent contains no
less than thirteen windows, with subjects biblical or allegorical,
but always strikingly rich in colour. The choir is, you may
say, an architectural frame to a series of glass pictures second
to few of their period, and so nearly all of a period as to give
one an excellent impression of it: the brilliancy of the colour,
the silveriness of the white glass, and the delicacy of the landscape
backgrounds is typical. Scarcely less interesting is the
abundant glass in the church of S. Patrice, which carries us
well into the middle of the sixteenth century and beyond; so
that Rouen is an excellent place in which to study all but Early
glass: there is not much of that to speak of there. Two
exceptionally fine Renaissance windows are to be found in the
church of S. Godard; and there are others well worth seeing
whilst you are in Rouen, if not in every case worth going there
to see, in the churches of S. Romain, S. Nicaise, S. Vivien, in
addition to S. Ouen, S. Maclou, and the cathedral.</p>

<p>Yet finer Renaissance work is to be found at Beauvais&mdash;finer,
that is to say, in design. One is reminded there sometimes
of Raffaelle, who furnished designs for the tapestries for which
the town was famous; these may very well have inspired the
glass painters; but there is not at Beauvais the quantity of
work which one finds at Rouen. The very perfection of workmanship
is to be seen also in the windows at Montmorency
and Ecouen (both within a very short distance of Paris); but,
on the whole, this most interesting glass hardly comes up to
what one might imagine it to be from the reproductions in
M. Magne&#8217;s most sumptuous monograph.</p>

<p>In a certain sense also the windows at Conches, in Normandy,
are a disappointment. In a series of windows designed by
Aldegrever one expects to find abundant ornament; and there is
practically none. What little there is, is like enough to his work
to be possibly by him; but one feels that Heinrich Aldegrever,
if he had had his way, would have lavished upon them a wealth
of ornamental detail, which would have made them much more
certainly his than, as it is, internal evidence proves them to
be. It would hardly have occurred to any one, apart from the
name in one of the windows, to attribute them to this greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
ornamentist among the Little Masters. It is only the ornamentist
who is disappointed, however, not the glass hunter. It
is an experience to have visited a church like Conches, simple,
well proportioned, dignified; where, as you enter from the West
(and the few modern windows are hidden), you see one expanse
of good glass, of a good period, not much hurt by restoration.
The effect is singularly one. You come away not remembering
so much the glass, or any particular window, as the
satisfactory impression of it all&mdash;an impression which inclines
you to put down the date of a pilgrimage to Conches as a
red-letter day in your glass-hunting experiences.</p>

<p>There is magnificent Renaissance glass in Flanders, and
especially at Li√®ge, in which, for the most part, Gothic tradition
lingers. Most beautiful is the great window in the South
transept of the cathedral. The radiance of the scene in which
the Coronation of the Virgin is laid, reminds one of nothing
less than a gorgeous golden sunset, which grows more mellow
towards evening when the light is low. In the choir of
S. Jacques there are no less than five tall three-light windows,
by no means so impressive as the glass at the cathedral, but
probably only less worthy of study because they have suffered
more restoration. The seven long two-light windows at
S. Martin, though less well-known, are at least as good as
these. In most of them may be seen the decorative use
of heraldry as a framework to figure subjects, characteristic
of German and Flemish work. Very much of this character
is the glass from Herkenrode, which now occupies the seven
easternmost windows of the Lady Chapel in Lichfield Cathedral.
They are pictorial, but the pictures are glass pictures,
depending upon colour for their effect; and they are really
admirable specimens of the more glass-like manner of the Early
Flemish Renaissance. There is in the three windows at the
East end of Hanover Square Church, London, some equally
admirable glass, which must once have belonged to a fine Jesse
window; but it has suffered too much in its adaptation to its
present position to be of great interest to any but those who
know something about glass.</p>

<p>All this work is in marked contrast to the not much later
Flemish glass at Brussels&mdash;the two great transept windows,
and those in the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament at S. Gudule,
to which reference is made at length in <a href="#Page_67">Chapter VII</a>. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
are windows which must be seen. They are at once the types,
and the best examples, of the glass painter&#8217;s new departure in
the direction of light and shade. On the other hand, the large
East window at S. Margaret&#8217;s, Westminster (Dutch, it is said,
of about the same date), has not the charm of the period, and
must not be taken to represent it fairly.</p>

<p>The brilliant achievements of William of Marseilles at
Arezzo, and the extraordinarily rich windows in the Duomo at
Florence, have been discussed at some length (<a href="#Page_248">pages 248</a>, <a href="#Page_268">268</a>).
They should be seen by any one pretending to some acquaintance
with what has been done in glass. Other Florentine windows
worthy of mention are, the Western Rose at S. Maria Novella,
and the great round window over the West door at S. Croce,
ascribed to Ghiberti. The transept window in SS. Giovanni
e Paolo at Venice does not come up to its reputation. It is in
a miserable condition, and as to its authorship (whence its
reputation), you have only to compare it with the S. Augustine
picture, which hangs close by, to see that it is not by the
same hand. One of the multitudinous Vivarini may very
likely have had a hand in it, but certainly not Bartolomeo.
His manner, even in his pictures, was more restrained than
that. There are a number of fine windows in the nave of
Milan Cathedral, two at least in which the composition of
red and blue is a joy to see. Earlier Italian glass is of less
importance; the windows at Assisi, for example, are interesting
rather than remarkable. They show a distinctly Italian
rendering of Gothic, which is of course not quite Gothic;
but to the designer they indicate trials in design, which
might possibly with advantage be carried farther.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">254. RAISING OF LAZARUS, AREZZO.</span></p>

<p>By far the most comprehensive series of Renaissance windows
in this country is in King&#8217;s College Chapel, Cambridge. In
the matter of dignity and depth of colour, the small amount of
rather earlier glass in the outer chapel holds its own; but the
thing to see, of course, is the array of windows, twenty-three
of them, all of great size, within the choir screen. It flatters
national vanity, though it may not show great critical acumen,
to ascribe them to English hands. Evidently many hands
were employed, some much more expert than others. It seems
there is documentary evidence to show that the contracts
for them (1516-1526) were undertaken by Englishmen. Very
possibly they were executed in England, and even, as it is said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397"></a><br /><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>they were, in London. That they were not painted by the
men who drew them, or even by painters in touch with the
draughtsmen, is indicated by such accidents as the yellow-haired,
white-faced negro, of pronounced African type, among
the adoring Magi. It is as clear that the painter had never
seen a black man as that the draughtsman had drawn his
Gaspar from the life. Certain of the accessory scroll-bearing
figures, which keep, as it were, ornamental guard between the
pictures, might possibly have been designed by Holbein, who
is reported to have had a hand in the scheme; but they are at
least as likely to be the handiwork of men unknown to fame.
But, no matter who designed the glass, it is on a grand scale,
and largely designed. It is not, however, a model of the fit
treatment of glass, though it belongs to the second quarter
of the sixteenth century. For the designers have been more
than half afraid to use leading enough to bind the glass well
together, and have been at quite unnecessary pains to do
without lead lines. The windows vary, too, in merit; and
they bear evidence, if only in the repetition of sundry stock
figures, of haste in production. Still, they have fine qualities
of design and colour, and they are, on the whole, glass-like
as well as delightful pictures. We have nothing to compare
with them in their way.</p>

<p>To see how far pictorial glass painting can be carried, go to
Holland. No degree of familiarity with old glass quite prepares
one for the kind of thing which has made the humdrum
market town of Gouda famous. Imagine a big, bare, empty
church with some thirty or more huge windows, mostly of six
lights, seldom less than five-and-twenty feet in height, all filled
with great glass pictures, some of them filling the whole window,
and designed to suggest that you see the scene through the
window arch. They do not, of course, quite give that impression,
but it is marvellous how near they go to doing it. No
wonder the painters have won the applause due to their daring
no less than to what they have done. Any one appreciating
the qualities of glass, and realising what can best be done
in it, is disposed at first to resent the popularity of this scene-painting
in glass;&mdash;one measures a work naturally by the standard
of its fame;&mdash;but a workman&#8217;s very appreciation of technique
must, in the end, commend to him this masterly glass painting.
For the Crabeth Brothers, their pupils, and coadjutors, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
not only artists of wonderful capacity, daring what only great
artists can dare, but they had the fortune to live at a time
when the traditions of their art had not yet been cast to the
winds. Though working during the latter half of the sixteenth
century, they were the direct descendants of the men who had
raised glass painting to the point of perfection, and they
inherited from their forbears much that they could not unlearn.
Ambitious as they might be, and impatient of restraint, they
could not quite emancipate themselves from the prejudices
in which they were brought up. More than a spark of the old
fire lay smouldering still in the kiln of the glass painter, and
it flared up at Gouda, brilliantly illuminating the declining
years of the century, and of the art which may be said to have
flickered out after that.</p>

<p>This last expiring effort in glass painting counts for more,
in that it is the doing not only of strong men but of men who
knew their trade. It is extremely interesting to trace the work
of the individual artists employed; which a little book published
at Gouda, and translated into most amusing English,
enables one to do. Dirk Crabeth&#8217;s work is pre-eminent for
dignity of design, his figures are well composed, and his colour
is rich; although in the rendering of architectural interiors he
falls into the mud, that is to say, into the prevailing Netherlandish
opacity of paint. His brother Walter has not such a
heavy hand; he excels in architectural distance, as Dirk does
in landscape; and his work is generally bright and sparkling,
not so strong as his brother&#8217;s, but more delicate. Their pupils,
too, do them credit, though they lack taste. Among the other
more or less known artists who took part in the glass, Lambrecht
van Ort distinguishes himself in canopy work, as a
painter-architect might be expected to do; Adrian de Vrije
and N. Johnson delight also in architecture, Wilhelmus Tibault
and Cornelius Clok in landscape. Clok and Tibault compete in
colour with the Crabeths, and go beyond them in originality.</p>

<p>Description of this unrivalled collection of later Dutch glass
painting, except on the spot, is as hopeless as it would be dull.
The windows must be seen. The men were artists and craftsmen,
and their work is truly wonderful. Who shall attempt
what these men failed to do? That is the moral of it.</p>

<p>The only other place where later glass is of sufficient worth
to make it worth seeing, the only place where Seventeenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400"></a><br />
<a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
century work arouses much interest, is Troyes. There is
a quantity of it in the churches of S. Nizier, S. Pantaleon,
and in the cathedral, attributed, for the most part, to Linard
Gontier, who is certainly responsible for some of the best of it.
But it is in the church of S. Martin-√®s-Vignes, in the outskirts
of the town, that it is to be appreciated <i>en masse</i>. There you
may see some hundred and ten lights in all, executed during the
first forty years of the seventeenth century. This is the place
to study the decline and fall of glass painting&mdash;a melancholy
sort of satisfaction. Here more thoroughly than ever must be
realised how hopeless it is to evade in glass the glazier&#8217;s part
of the business; how powerless enamel is to produce effect;
how weak, poor, lacking in limpidity and lustre, its colour is&mdash;and
this even in the hands of an artist born, one may say, after
his time. Gonthier was an incomparable glass painter. He
could produce with a wash of pigment effects which lesser men
could only get by laborious stippling and scratching; he could
float enamel on to glass with a dexterity which enabled him to
get something like colour in it; but he was not a colourist,
nor yet, probably, a designer. The difference in the work attributed
to him, and the style of his design (which is sometimes
that of an earlier and better day) lead one rather to suppose
that he adapted or adopted the designs of his predecessors
as suited his convenience.</p>

<p>To see what glass painting came to in the eighteenth
century you cannot do better than go to Oxford. You have
there the design of no less a man than Sir Joshua Reynolds,
painted by one of the best china painters of his day. None
but a china painter, by the way, could be found to do it.
It is not unfair, therefore, to compare this masterpiece
of its poor period with the rude work of the fourteenth
century, done by no one knows whom. And what do we
find? Conspicuous before us is the great West window,
which might as well have been painted on linen, so little
of the translucency of glass is there left in it. It in no way
lessens the credit of the great portrait painter that he knew
nothing of the capacities of glass; that was not his <i>m√©tier</i>.
And there was no one to advise him wisely in the matter.
But the result is disastrous. The beauty of his drawing&mdash;and
there is charm at least in the figures of the Virtues&mdash;counts
for little, as compared with the dulness of it all.  It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
neither the colour of mosaic glass nor the sparkle of grisaille.
The white is obscured by masses of heavy paint, which, when
the sun shines very brightly behind it, kindles at best into
a foxy-brown; and even this is in danger of peeling off, and
showing the poverty of the glass it was meant to enrich. Any
pictorial effect it might have had is ruined by the leads and
bars, which assert themselves in the most uncompromising
manner. In short, the qualities of oil painting aimed at are
altogether missed, and the facilities which glass offered are
not so much as sought.</p>

<p>It is no hardship to turn your back upon such poor stuff.
And there, high up on the other side, are seven great Gothic
windows. These are by no means of the best period. The
design consists largely of canopy work, never profoundly interesting;
the figures are, at the best, rudely drawn; some of
them are even grotesquely awkward. Their heads are too
large by half, their hands and feet flattened out in the familiar,
childish, medi√¶val way. In all the sixty-four figures there is
not one that can be called beautiful. Yet for all that, there is
a dignity in them which the graceful Virtues lack. They are
designed, moreover, with a large sense of decoration. The
balance of white and colour is just perfect, and the way the
patches of deep colour are embedded, as it were, in grisaille,
is skilful in the extreme. To compare them with the futile
effort of the eighteenth century, opposite, is to apprehend
what can be done in glass, and what cannot. The whole
secret of the success of the mere craftsman where the great
painter failed, is that he knew what to seek in glass,&mdash;colour,
brilliancy, decorative breadth. He not only knew what to
do, but how to do it; and he did it in the manliest and
most straightforward way. Rude though the work, it fits
its place, fulfils its function, adorns the architecture, gives
grandeur to it. What more can you ask?</p>

<p>Domestic glass, such as that in which the Swiss excelled
(window panes, many of them, rather than windows), is best
studied in museums, whither most of it has drifted. There is
no national collection without good examples. Better or more
accessible it would be difficult to find than those in the quiet
little museum at Lucerne&mdash;so quiet that, if you spend a morning
there, studying them, you become yourself, by reason of your
long stay, an object of interest. So little attention do these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
masterpieces in miniature glass painting attract, that the
guardians do not expect any one to give them more than
a passing glance; but they leave you, happily, quite free
to pursue your harmless, if inexplicable, bent.</p>

<p>The list of windows worth seeing is by no means exhausted.
In many a town, as at York, Tours, Troyes, Evreux, Bourges,
Rouen, Nuremberg, Cologne, and in many a single church, you
may find the whole course of glass painting, from the thirteenth
to the sixteenth century, more or less completely illustrated;
and, where that is so, of course one period throws light upon
another. But the impression is always stronger when the
century has left its mark upon the church.</p>

<p>Not until you have a clear idea of the characteristics of style,
can you sort out for yourself the various specimens, which occur
in anything but historic sequence in the churches where they
are to be found. Having arrived at understanding enough to do
that, you will need no further guidance, and may go a-hunting
for yourself. To the glass hunter there are almost everywhere
windows worth seeing.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br />
<br />
A WORD ON RESTORATION.</h3>

<p>If old windows have suffered at the hands of time, they have
also gained, apart from sentiment, a tone and quality which the
glass had not when it was new.</p>

<p>Their arch-enemy is the restorer, at whose hands they have
suffered cruel and irreparable wrong. He is the thief who has
robbed so much old glass of its glory, and a most impenitent
one: there are times when any one who cares for glass could
find it in his heart to wish he were crucified. So greedy is he
of work, if not of gain, that restoration cannot safely be left
even to the most learned of men; to him, perhaps, can it least
of all be entrusted.</p>

<p>The twelfth century windows at S. Denis should be among
the most interesting extant. They are ruined by restoration.
The beauty which they may have had, which they must have
had, is wiped out; and, for purposes of study, they are of
use only to those who have opportunity and leisure to ferret
out what is genuine amidst the sham. The S. Chapelle is
cited as a triumph of restoration, an object lesson, in which
we may see a thirteenth century chapel with its glass as it
appeared when first it was built. If that is so, then time
has indeed been kinder even than one had thought. No less
an authority than Mr. Ruskin (in a letter to Mr. E. S. Dallas,
published in the <i>Athen√¶um</i>) praises the new work there, and
says he cannot distinguish it from the old. There is at least
a window and a half (part of the East window, and the
one to the left of that) in which, at all events, the old is easily
distinguishable from the new. But if the new is not more
obvious throughout, that is not because the new is so good, but
because the old has been so restored that it is unrecognisable&mdash;as
good as new, in fact, and no better. The old glass is so
smartened up, so watered down with modern, that it gives one
rather a poor idea of unspoiled thirteenth century work. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
more adequate impression of what it must have been, may
be gained from the few panels of it, comparatively unhurt by
restoration, now in South Kensington Museum.</p>

<p>The story of destruction repeats itself wherever the restorer
has had his way. Sometimes he has actually inserted new
material if only the old was cracked, obscured, corroded; and
has effaced the very qualities which come of age and accident.
Sometimes he has indulged in a brand-new background. There,
at least, it seemed to his ignorance, he might safely substitute
nice, new, even-tinted, well-made glass for streaky, speckled,
rough, mechanically imperfect material. Invariably he has
thinned the effect of colour by diluting the old glass with new.
Many quite poor new-looking windows, spick and span from the
restorer (those, for example, at the East end of Milan Cathedral),
turn out to contain a certain amount of old work, good perhaps,
lost in garish modern manufacture. At Notre Dame, at Paris,
the considerable remains of Early and Early Decorated glass
go for very little. One has to pick them out from among
modern work designed to deceive. Certain windows at Mantes
have suffered such thorough restoration that one begins to
wonder if they are not altogether new; and you have precisely
the same doubt at Limoges and at scores of other places. At
Lyons an Early Rose has been made peculiarly hideous by
restoration. Much of the harsh purple in Early French mosaic
is surely due to the admixture of crude new glass. It is needless
to multiply examples; they will occur to every one. All this
old work swamped in modern imitation goes inevitably for
nought. If the new is good it puzzles and perplexes one; if
bad, one can see nothing else. What is crude kills what is
subdued. It is as if one listened for a tender word at parting,
and it was drowned in the screech of the steam-engine.</p>

<p>Early glass was so mechanically imperfect, and age has so
roughened and pitted it, that its colour has, almost of necessity,
a quality which new work has not; and one is disposed,
perhaps too hastily, to ascribe all garish glass in old windows
to the restorer. Many a time, however, the new work convicts
itself. At Strassburg it is quite easily detected. You may
check your judgment in this respect by surveying the windows
from the rear. It is a very good plan to preface the study of
old work by examining it from the churchyard, the street, the
close, or in the case of a big church from its outer galleries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
The surface exposed to the weather, with the light upon it,
explains often at a glance what would else be unaccountable.
A vile habit of the restorer is to smudge over his glass with
dirty paint, perhaps burnt in, perhaps merely in varnish colour;
this he terms &#8220;antiquating.&#8221;</p>

<p>The worse the new work added to the old, the more
thoroughly it spoils it; the better the forgery, the more serious
the doubt it throws upon what may be genuine. The modern
ideal of restoration is thoroughly vicious. All that can be
done is mending; and it should be an axiom with the repairer,
that, where glass (however broken) can possibly be made safe
by lead joints, no new piece of glass should ever be inserted in
its place. Better any disfigurement by leads than the least
adulteration of old work.</p>

<p>It is absurd to set good old work in the midst of inferior
reproduction of it, as the common practice is, more especially
in the case of Early work. Every bungler has thought himself
equal to the task of restoring thirteenth century glass. It was
rudely drawn and roughly painted. What could be easier than
to repeat details of ornament, or even to make up bogus old
subjects, and so complete the window? To paint figures anything
like those in the picture windows of the sixteenth
century was obviously not so easy, and the difficulty has acted
as a deterrent. Where it has not, the discrepancy between old
and new is usually unmistakable. Men like M. Capronnier,
however, have sometimes put excellent workmanship into
their restoration of Renaissance work, to be detected only by
a certain air of modernity, which happily has crept into it, in
spite of the restorer. But was it not he who flattened the
grey-blue background to the transept windows at S. Gudule?
The fine window at S. Gervais, Paris, with the Judgment of
Solomon, has lost much of its charm in restoration. To compare
it with the two lights in the window to the right of it, is to
see how much of the quality of old glass has been restored
away. That quality may be due in part to age and decay.
What then? Beauty is beauty; and if it comes of decay (which
we cannot hinder), let us at least enjoy the beauty of decay.</p>

<p>It has been proved at Strassburg that thirteenth or even
twelfth century work may be quite harmoniously worked into
fourteenth century windows. And even in the sixteenth century
there were artists who managed to adapt quite Early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
mosaic glass to Renaissance windows, in which abundant stain,
and even enamel, was used. The effect may be perplexing, but
it does not deceive. Why will not a man frankly tell us what
is new in his work? Then we could appreciate what he had
done. But it is only once in a while that he takes you into his
confidence. This happens, by way of exception, in a window
at S. Mary&#8217;s Redcliffe, Bristol, in the case of some figure
work on quarry backgrounds, in which the new work is all
of clear unpainted white or coloured glass, but so judiciously
chosen that you do not at first perceive the patching. The
effect is absolutely harmonious; and when you begin to study
the glass, you do so without any fear that imposition is being
practised upon you. Where the painting has in parts been
made good, there is always that fear, as, for example, at
S. Mary&#8217;s Hall, Coventry: the windows have been restored
with great taste; but one cannot always be quite sure as to
what is modern.</p>

<span class="caption">256. <span class="smcap">A Restoration at Angers.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The merest jumble of old glass, more especially if it be all of
one period or quality, is far better than what is called restoration.
Who does not call to mind window after window in
which the glass is so mixed as to be quite meaningless, and is
yet, for all that, beautiful? The Western Rose at Reims is an
unintelligible jumble mainly of blue and green. It may not be
design, but it is magnificent. Again, the Western lights at
Auxerre, in great part patchwork, are simply glorious when
the afternoon sun shines through.</p>

<p>At the East end of Winchester Cathedral is a seven-light
window, reckoned by Winston to be one of the finest of a fine
period. At the West end is an enormous window, which seems
to be a mere medley of odds and ends. On examination you
can trace in perhaps twelve out of forty-four lights of this last
the outline of canopy-work, and in two or three that of the
figure under it; but for the rest, certainly in the two lower
tiers (which are best seen), it is mere patchwork, including some
quite crude blue, and a certain amount of common clear white
sheet. The effect, when you examine it closely, is anything
but pleasing. But as you stand near the choir screen on a not
very bright morning, and look from one window to the other, the
effect is just the opposite of what might have been expected.
For the really fine East window has been restored; and,
whether to preserve it or to bring old work and new into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
uniformity, it has been screened with sheets of perforated zinc! On the
other hand, the really considerable amount of crude white and colour
with which the West window has been botched is, so to speak, swallowed
up in silvery radiance. Probably it helps even to give it quality;
anyway, the effect is delightful. Indeed, it recalls the impression of
the Five Sisters at York, or suggests some monster cobweb in which the
light is caught. Beauty, forbid that any busybody should restore it! At
Poitiers (S. Radegonde) is a grisaille window of the fourteenth century,
all patched, defaced, undecipherable&mdash;mended only with thick
bulbous bits of green-white glass&mdash;which is quite all one could
desire in the way of decoration.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="caption">257. <span class="smcap">S. Jean-aux-Bois.</span></span></p>

<p>In very many churches there remain fragments of old glass in stray
tracery openings, not enough to produce effect. The question has been
what to do with them. A common practice is to use up such scraps in the
form of bordering to common white quarry glass. That is quite a futile
thing to do. The effect of setting old glass amidst plain white is to
put out its colour; and this, not only in the case of deep-coloured
glass, but equally of Early grisaille; which when framed in clear glass,
looks merely dirty. The most beautiful and sparkling of thirteenth
century glass so framed would be degraded. At Angers are some windows
consisting of a mosaic of scraps worked up into pattern (before the days
of restoration as we know it); and the mere introduction amidst it of a
strapwork of thin white sheet (<a href="#Fig_256">above</a>) is enough to take from it all
charm of colour, all quality of old glass. Massed all together in one
window, without such adulteration, the most miscellaneous collection of
chips makes usually colour. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span> hands of a colourist it
would be certain to do so. What if it be confused? Mystery is, at all
events, one element of charm, and even of beauty.</p>

<p>It is not beyond the bounds of possibility to marry old work
with new; but the union is rarely happy. It wants, in the first
place, good modern glass. Further than that, it wants an
artist, and one who has more care for old work than for his
own. There is some satisfactory eking out old glass with new
at Evreux, where a number of small subjects, many of them
old, are framed in grisaille, in great part new, in a very
ingenious way. At Munster is a window in which little tracery
lights (you can tell that by their shapes) are used as points of
interest in a modern composition&mdash;with a result, only less happy
than where, at S. Mary&#8217;s Redcliffe, a window is made up almost
entirely of old glass, very much of one period, the more
fragmentary remains forming a sort of broken mosaic background
to circular medallions, heads, and other important
pieces, arranged more or less pattern-wise upon it. Old glass
must needs be mended sometimes, patched perhaps; new may
have to be added to it; it has even to be adapted on occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
to a new window, with or without the admixture of new; but
none of this is restoration of the glass in the modern sense.
That implies restoring it to what once it was&mdash;which is, on the
face of it, absurd.</p>

<p>The effect of windows made up (as at S. Jean-aux-Bois,
<a href="#Fig_257">page 409</a>) of segments of two or three old windows satisfies
the artistic sense perfectly. What the restorer does is to take
each pattern he finds in it for what he calls &#8220;authority,&#8221; and
to make two or three windows, all of which have much more
the appearance of modern forgeries (which in great part they
are) than of old work. The &#8220;antiquation&#8221; of the new glass
in them deceives none but the most ignorant; but it does
throw doubt upon the genuineness of the old work found in
such very bad company.</p>

<p>If there remain enough old glass to make a window, let it be
judiciously repaired; if there be not enough for that, let it
be piously preserved, best of all, in a museum, where those
who care for such scraps may see it: scattered about in stray
windows in out-of-the-way churches they are practically unseen.
Better than what is called restoration, the brutality of the
mason who plasters up gaps in the clerestory windows of great
churches with mortar, or the plumber&#8217;s patch of zinc, which
temporarily at least keeps out the weather and the crude white
light, leaving us in full enjoyment of the colour and effect of
old glass. How grateful we are when it is only cobbled, and
not restored. Restoration is a word to make the artist shudder.</p>

<p>In a window at Auch, representing the Risen Christ, with, on the
one side, the doubting Thomas, and on the other the Magdalene,
the customary inscription, &#8220;Noli me tangere,&#8221; is followed (in
letters of precisely the same character) by the signature of the
artist, Arnaut de Moles. It is the reverend Abb√© responsible
for the authorised description of the church, who suggests that
it may have been with intention he signed his name just there.
He has come off, as it happens, very much better at the hands
of the restorer than most men. Had it been possible for him
to foresee what nineteenth century &#8220;restoration&#8221; meant, well
might he have written over his signature &#8220;Leave me alone&#8221;!</p>
